        text: `<p>Q. Is vanity an essential of false personality?</p>
<p>A. It is one of the features of false personality in one or another sense. In some people it may be the chief feature, and then it is very obvious and visible, but very often these features are behind other things and do not show themselves.</p>`

        text: `<p>False personality is a complex formation, consisting of many elements, and it is not the same in different people. It is always changing, and it is never the same for two consecutive moments in the same person. It is very difficult to give a definition of false personality which would be true for all cases. But one thing is certain, that false personality is always something separate from oneself.</p>`

        text: `<p>Q: Is it only by separation that one can work on identification?</p>
<p>A: Only. Without realizing the difference between 'I' and false personality all efforts only strengthen the weaker side. As I said, this separation is the basis of all work on oneself. Unless this idea is understood, nothing can be attained, in everything one must start from that. This is the real difference between people in the work and not in the work. People who are not in the work think that they are what they are. People in the work already understand that they are not what they seem to be. This separation must pass through many phases, but it must begin.</p>`

        text: `<p>All the rest is 'Ouspensky' or 'false personality'. 'Ouspensky' is our imaginary picture of ourselves, because we put into it all that we think of ourselves, which is generally imaginary. All study comes down to the study of this imaginary picture and to separating ourselves from it. So at present you can call 'I' your valuation of the system. This is 'you'. From your attitude to the system, work in the system, interest in the system, 'I' can grow. On this basis you can separate 'I' from false personality. There is no guarantee that it will be absolutely right, but this method has a great practical value. False personality is always against the work for self-development and spoils the work of all other personalities. It can never be useful.</p>`

      {
        text: `<p>Q. What is the difference between real personalities and false personality?</p>
<p>A. You mix two divisions which are quite different and on a different scale, so they cannot be compared. Personalities (in the plural) spoken of in relation to essence, for I said that personality can be divided into different personalities which compose it. The division into essence and personality is at present merely theoretical and is only useful as a principle, for it is difficult to see it in oneself. We do not know our personalities, so we begin to study from two ends. We study first that personality which is connected with the work and which has developed from the magnetic centre; and then we study false personality, on quite a different scale. False personality is opposed to 'you', it is your wrong idea of yourself exactly what you are not. This division is practical, for it is necessary to know definitely what your false personality looks like. So you must not confuse false personality with personalities, because, although they are not very real, personalities may be based on real inclinations, real tastes and likes, whereas false personality is all false and may even pretend to like something that 'you' dislike or to dislike something 'you' really like. When you speak about false personality, you take 'you' as existing and false personality as not; when you speak about personalities, you leave false personality out of the conversation and discuss different divisions of what you consider to be 'yourself'. False personality must not become just a word. Everybody who speaks about it must have some picture of himself in the power of false personality. Only if this term is used like that can it give some result.</p>`
      },
      {
        text: `<p>Q. Could you say more about what 'I' is?</p>
<p>A. 'I' is only presumed; we do not know what 'I' is. But 'Ouspensky' I know and I can study him in all his manifestations. So I must begin with 'Ouspensky'. 'I' is elusive and very small; it exists only as a potentiality; if it does not grow, false personality will continue to control everything. Many people make the mistake of thinking that they know which is which. They say 'this is I', when in reality it is false personality. This is generally connected with our capacity to play roles. It is a very limited capacity; we generally have about five or six roles, whether we observe it or not. We may notice a certain, quite misleading, similarity between these roles and then, consciously or unconsciously, come to the conclusion that behind them there stands a permanent individuality. We call it 'I' and think that it is behind all manifestations, when in reality it is an imaginary picture of ourselves. This picture has to be studied. It is impossible to have a practical knowledge of oneself if one does not know one's false personality. As long as we think we are one, all our definitions are wrong. Only when a man knows that all his intentions, desires and so on are not real, that they are false personality, only then can he get something. This is the only practical work possible, and it is very difficult. False personality has to disappear, or at least be rendered powerless to hinder our work. But it will defend itself and will not give in easily. Work is struggle with false personality which will fight back, chiefly through lying, for lying is its strongest weapon.</p>`

      {
        text: `<p>Q: It seems to me that false personality is the only thing that can adapt to some new circumstance, it can play a new role and make it more comfortable.</p>
<p>A. False personality does not really adapt. To adapt in the ordinary sense means, more or less, a controlled action. False personality reacts in a different way, according to what it is, but it cannot adapt. And it does not necessarily make things more comfortable - you cannot rely on it. You must understand that you have not the slightest control of false personality. When we begin to see it we realize that it controls everything and nothing can control it. So you cannot call it adaptation. You must separate in yourself what you can control and what you cannot control. What you cannot control belongs to false personality, and what you can control belongs to you.</p>

<p>Q. How can one deal with the conceit of false personality?</p>
<p>A. You must know all its features first and then you must think rightly.<em> When you think rightly you will find ways to deal with it. You must not justify it; it lives on justification, and even glorification, of all its features. At any moment of our life, even in quiet moments, we are always justifying it, considering it legitimate and finding all possible excuses for it. This is what I call wrong thinking.</em> In studying false personality we begin to see mechanicalness more and more. Parallel with the realization of our mechanicalness we study how to get out of it by means of creating something that is not mechanical. How can we do it? First we must think about what we want, separate the important from the unimportant. Work on oneself, desire to know oneself and the ideas of the work, struggle to create consciousness, are not mechanical that we can be sure of. And if we look from this point of view we will see many imaginary things in ourselves. These imaginary things are false personality: imaginary emotions, imaginary interests, imaginary ideas about ourselves. False personality is utterly mechanical, so it is again the division into conscious and mechanical. This mechanical part of us is chiefly based on imagination, on wrong views of everything, and above all on a wrong view of ourselves. We must realize how much we are in the power of this false personality and invented things which have no real existence, and we must separate what we can really depend on from what is not dependable in ourselves. That may serve as the beginning. When we know ourselves better, this will help us to awake.</p>

<p>Q. Do you mean we must study our false personality by collecting material, observations?</p>
<p>A. By dividing yourself, by not saying 'I' to everything. You can really use the word 'I' only in relation to the more conscious part of yourself: desire to work, desire to understand, realization of not understanding, realization of mechanicalness; that you can call 'I'. 'I' starts growing only in connection with study, with work on oneself; otherwise it cannot grow and there is no change. A permanent 'I' does not come all at once. All illusory 'I's disappear little by little and real 'I' gradually grows stronger and stronger, chiefly through self-remembering. Self-remembering in the sense of just awareness is very good, but little by little when you go on it becomes connected with other interests, with what you want to get. At present, one moment you remember it, and then for a day or a week you forget it; but it is necessary to remember it all the time.</p>`
      },
      {
        text: `<p>Q. Is the object of self-remembering the gradual discovery of permanent 'I'?</p>
<p>A. Not the discovery; it is preparing the ground for it. Permanent 'I' is not there. It must grow, but it cannot grow when it is all covered with negative emotions, identification and other such things. So you begin by preparing the ground for it. But first of all, as I said before, it is necessary to understand what self-remembering is, why it is better to self-remember, what effect it will produce, and so on. It needs thinking about. Besides, in trying to self-remember it is necessary to keep the connection with all the other ideas of the system. If one takes one thing and omits another thing for instance, if one seriously works on self-remembering without knowing about the idea of the division of 'I's, so that one takes oneself as one (as a unity) from the beginning then self-remembering will give wrong results and may even make development impossible. There are schools, for instance, or systems which, although they do not formulate it in this way, are actually based on false personality and on struggle against conscience. Such work must certainly produce wrong results. At first it will create a certain kind of strength, but it will make the development of higher consciousness an impossibility. False personality either destroys or distorts memory. Self-remembering is a thing that must be based on right function. At the same time as working on it you must work on the weakening of false personality. Several lines of work are suggested and explained from the beginning, and all must go together. You cannot just do one thing and not another. All are necessary for creating this right combination, but first must come the understanding of the struggle with false personality. Suppose one tries to remember oneself and does not wish to make efforts against false personality. Then all its features will come into play, saying, 'I dislike these people', 'I do not want this', 'I do not want that', and so on. Then it will not be work but quite the opposite. As I said, if one tries to work in this wrong way it may make one stronger than one was before, but in such a case the stronger one becomes, the less is the possibility of development. Fixing before development that is the danger.</p>

<p> Q. Is that something that one should be on guard against?</p>
<p>A. Certainly. Only a little part of you wants to self-remember, and other personalities, or 'I's, do not want it at all. It is necessary to find them and expose them, to see which are useful for this work, which are indifferent and which are so asleep that they do not know anything about it. The aim is to have control over one's 'I's, or personalities, to be able to bring one or another up, to arrange them in a certain way. The 'I' that has control will not be one of these you have now. This idea of the formation of real 'I' is most important; it cannot be formed accidentally. In most cases we are satisfied with a philosophical idea of'I'; we believe that we have it and do not realize that actually we pass from one 'I' to another.</p>

 <p>Q. In considering likes and dislikes, how can one separate what is real and what is false personality?</p>
<p>A. Start by realizing that it is all false personality, and then try to find out what is not. You cannot do the second before the first. First you must understand that all is false personality, and when you become<convinced of that, you may find what is 'yourself'. Go on observing. Work begins from the moment one realizes that one is not. When it enters into everything, when it becomes a realization, then it is productive work. But when one thinks of oneself as 'I' (the whole), then it is not productive work. You must understand that false personality is a very elusive thing. It is one, it does not consist of different personalities; but at the same time it contains contradictory and incompatible features, features that cannot manifest themselves at the same time. So it does not mean that you can see the whole of your false personality at one moment. Sometimes you can see more of it, at other times certain features of it manifest
 themselves separately. Also it must be remembered that false personality is often rather attractive or amusing, particularly for other people who live in their false personalities. So when you begin to lose your false personality, when you begin to struggle with it, people will not like you. They will tell you that you have become dull.</p>

 <p>Q. How can one tell what is not false personality?</p> 
 <p>A. One thing false personality cannot do is make efforts. This is the easiest way to know, if you are in doubt. False personality always tries to make everything as easy as possible, always chooses what requires least effort. But you must understand that you cannot learn anything or change anything without effort. So when you find an 'I' or a group of 'I's which are ready to make efforts, it means that they do not belong to false personality.<p>
 
<p>Q. Can one acquire a new false personality with regard to the system?</p>
 <p>A. If one does not think about or understand false personality and if one deceives oneself, thinking that one works, one will not acquirea new false personality, but false personality will grow. So it must be kept out, if not destroyed, soon after the beginning.</p>

<p>Q. My idea of myself often makes me think I am not properly valued and therefore I suffer because of my picture of myself.</p>

<p> A. Quite right, but do not think about the picture; you must only remember the direction. You may be mistaken in your ideas about yourself, but it is not important. Only, the direction must be right; you cannot go somewhere without knowing where you are going. You can see your imaginary picture of yourself only from the right point, and the right point is the direction. There is no other point from which you can see it.</p>

<p>Q. Could you say again what takes the place of real 'I' at present?</p>
<p>A. Desire to know. From this, real 'I' will grow, if it does. In the beginning it is difficult to define, it is the aim. If you connect yourself with a certain work, with a certain system, it begins to grow; but it cannot grow by itself, merely through happy circumstances. It is quite simple to establish that we have no permanent 'I'. Try to remember yourself for fifteen minutes; this will show the degree of your being. If you had a permanent 'I', you would be able to remember yourself for fifteen hours. It is all very simple, really, only we have no keys to our machine. If we had the keys, it would be easy to open it and see what is inside, and then separate the imaginary from the real. But even that we have to learn: we are too used to the unreal. So the subject of our study must be false personality, which is always there. Only if you know it in all its manifestations can you separate what is 'I'. We are identified with our imaginary picture of ourselves and it is a very dangerous form of identification.</p>

<p>Q. How can one begin to distinguish what is real?</p>
<p>A. You cannot. But you can distinguish what is unreal, just in the same way as you distinguish truth and lying. There is no need of philosophy; take it simply. We must first apply discrimination to simple things. Imagination plays a very important part in our life, because we believe in it. The real can grow only at the expense of the imaginary. But in ordinary life the unreal grows at the expense of the real.</p>

<p>Q. I do not quite understand the division between work and ordinary life.</p>
<p> A. The relation of personal work to life is precisely this relation of permanent 'I' to false personality. Work is permanent 'I' in the essence, and ordinary life is false personality. When you understand what permanent 'I' is, when you are conscious of yourself and have permanent control, this is work. At present you live in false personality.</p>

 <p>Q. I find it difficult to see the difference between 'I' and 'Miss B.'.</p>
<p>A. As I have just said, in the division of 'I' and 'Miss B' practically all is 'Miss B'. 'You' can outgrow 'Miss B' only from your interest in the system, because real'I' cannot grow from anything else. All the material that is there will never come to anything without these ideas, without this interest, because it keeps it on a certain line, in a certain direction. At first you study, observe yourself and so on, then, after some time,
 if you work, 'I' will appear for a second from time to time, but you will not be able to keep it and it will disappear again. This will go on for some time, and then, at a certain moment, it will appear and stay long enough for you to recognize and remember it. This is the way of all new things; at first they come for very short moments, then they stay longer. It is the natural way of growth, it cannot be otherwise. We have in us too many momentums of mechanical habits of thinking and too many otherwrong things. Real'I' appears and is immediately squashed. When you understand more about false personality you will realize that you are surrounded by it. You cannot see anything without the eyes of false personality, you cannot hear without the ears of false personality or speak without the voice of false personality. Everything goes through false personality, and the first step is to know it, because then you will know how much of your life it occupies.</p>

<p> Q. Since false personality is imaginary, does it really exist?</p>
<p>A. It does not really exist, but we imagine it exists. It exists in its manifestations, but not as a real part of ourselves. It is a combination of 'I's that have no real foundation, but they act and produce certain effects. Do not try to define it, or you will lose your way in words, and we must deal with facts. Negative emotions exist, yet at the same time they do not exist, since there is no real centre for them. It is the same with false personality. It is one of the misfortunes of our state that we are full of non-existent things. You must understand that you cannot even begin to work on the level you are; you have to change certain things first. You can find what to change only as a result of
 your observations. Sometimes it becomes very clear, and only then does the fight begin, because false personality begins to defend itself. You must know false personality first. All that we speak about now, refers to the first stage understanding that we do not know false personality, that in order to know it we must study, that all the work we do is done at the expense of false personality, that all the work we can do on ourselves means diminishing the power of false personality, and that if we begin to try and work, leaving false personality without disturbing it, all the work will come to nothing. I repeat again you must understand that false personality is a combination of all lies. features and 'I's that can never be useful in any sense, either in life or in the work just like negative emotions. Yet false personality always says 'I' and always ascribes to itself many capacities, such as will, self-consciousness and so on, and if it is not checked it remains an obstacleto all the work. So one of the first and most important factors, in trying to change oneself, is this division of oneself into 'I' and whatever your name may be. If this division is not made, if one forgets it and continues to think of oneself in the usual way, or if one divides oneself in a wrong way, work stops. Work on oneself can only progress on the basis of this division, but it must be the right division. It often happens that people make a wrong division: what they like in themselves they call 'I' and what they dislike, or what in their opinion is weak or unimportant, they call false personality. This is quite a wrong division; it changes nothing and one remains as one was. This wrong division is simply lying, lying to oneself, which is worse than anything, because the moment one meets with the smallest difficulty it will show itsel fby inner arguing and wrong understanding. If one uses a wrong division, it will not be reliable and will fail one in a moment of need. To make a right division of oneself one must understand what is 'I' and what is 'Ouspensky', 'Brown' or 'Jones', in other words, what is lying and what is oneself. As I said, even if you admit this possibility of dividing yourself, you are bound to call what you like in yourself 'I' and what you dislike 'Not I', for the right division cannot be found at once; you must find some indications in connection with the work which will help. For instance, if you say that your aim is to be free, it is first of all necessary to understand that you are not free. If you understand to what extent you are not free and if you formulate your desire to be free, you will then see in yourself which part of you wants to be free and which part does not. This would be a beginning.</p>

<p>Q. Can one see false personality without help?</p>
<p> A. There is nothing against it theoretically, only I never saw such a case. Even with help, people will not see it. You can show a man a mirror, and he will say, 'This is not me, it is an artificial mirror, not a real mirror. It is not a reflection of me.'</p>

<p>Q. How can one eliminate false personality?</p>
<p>A. You cannot eliminate it. It is just the same as trying to cut your head off. But you can make it less insistent, less permanent. If your false personality is there for twenty three hours out of the twenty-four, when work begins it will be there only twenty-two hours and 'you' will be present an hour longer. If, at a certain moment, you feel the danger of a manifestation of false personality and you find a way to stop it, this is what you have to begin with. The question of elimination does not enter at all it is connected with quite different things. You must have control.</p>

<p>Q. Isn't the study of false personality analysing oneself? I thought it was a bad thing?</p>
<p> A. To a certain extent it is analysing. What was said about refraining from analysis was in the first lecture. I said then that analysis was impossible because you do not know enough. Analysis means establishing causes and effects. So at first I said that you have to abstain from analysis and just observe, observe, observe, nothing more, because the time for analysis would come when you knew the laws. Now we are studying these laws, so certainly you have to analyse more and more. You see, rules for observation and thinking in the first lecture are one thing, but with the passing of time they change and modify. What one cannot do in the first month one already must do in the second month. Both difficulties and possibilities increase all the time. Analysis must be used carefully, when it is necessary, not for everything. Sometimes it is only a waste of time.</p>

<p>Q. Would you say that false personality is sometimes built up by other people for instance, when people say in front of a child that they hate strangers?</p>
<p> A. Quite right. False personality is built up from many sides, and certainly to a great extent by suggestions from other people.
 A child gets many suggestions, especially about his likes and dislikes.</p>
 <p>Q. I don't quite follow how to find the 'I's that object to the work. Does it mean we should sift out what the 'I's are?</p>
<p> A. You must not think theoretically about it. Try to find what in you objects to the ideas of the system, or try to find the 'I's (or you can call them anything you like)which are indifferent to it. Suppose you have certain definite tastes in food. These 'I's which are interested in food cannot be interested in self-remembering. Then there are other 'I's interested in things opposed to self-remembering. There are many things you can do with pleasure only if you do not remember yourself, and naturally these 'I's will be very inimical to self-remembering, becauseit will only spoil their pleasure. Try to find them in that way. Theoretical approaches will not help.</p>
<p> Q. What is the origin of these artificial groups of 'I's?</p>
<p> A. They may be formed by imitation, desire to be original, to be attractive, to be
 admired by people and so on.</p>

<p> Q. When you find a group of 'I's which do not want to self-remember, what do you do about it?</p>
 <p>A. Leave it alone. If it does not want to, what can you do with it? If there are groups of 'I's that want to, work on them. Those'I's which realize the necessity to self-remember must work with other 'I's that also want to. They must not spend their time in persuading other 'I's.</p>

<p> Q. Is it to be expected that some'I's in a man would be frightened of the idea of separating 'I' from 'Mr. A'?</p>
<p> A. Certainly all 'I's which constitute false personality will be frightened, because it is death to them. But you must understand that they may show their fear only for sometime and, after that, they may disguise themselves in order not to die. You may seriously think that you have finished with false personality, whereas it is only concealing itself inside some feature, ready to appear. This feature is always weakness. So long as it remains it takes all energy, but it may be very well disguised, and in that form it may even become stronger, growing parallel with the growth of real 'I'. So the realization of the necessity of this division into 'I' and 'Mr. A' is not sufficient to destroy it. You must remember that false personality defends itself.</p>

<p> Q. Is false personality based on negative emotions?</p>
<p> A. There are many other things in false personality besides negative emotions. For instance, there are always bad mental habits; false personality, or parts of false personality are always based on wrong thinking. Although to a certain extent you are right: in some cases if you take negative emotions away from false personality it collapses, for it cannot live without them. On the other hand, some false personalities can function on most pleasant emotions. There are very cheerful false personalities and in this way your false personality can deceive you and make you believe that you are struggling with negative emotions. It can deceive you in many different ways.</p>

 <p>Q. Do all negative emotions spring from false personality?</p>
<p>A. How could it be other wise? It is, so to speak, a special organ for negative emotions, for displaying, enjoying and producing them. You remember that there is no real centre for negative emotions. False personality acts as a centre fo them.</p>

<p> Q. Is identification always a manifestation of false personality?</p>
<p> A. False personality cannot manifest itself without identification, the same as negative emotions and many other things in us, such as all lying, all imagination. One identifies, first of all, with one's imaginary idea of oneself. One says 'this is I' when it is nothing but imagination. It is the same with lying - one cannot lie without identification; it would be very poor lying and nobody would believe it. So it means that first one must deceive oneself, and then one can deceive other people. Study of false personality is one of the quickest methods for self-remembering. The more you understand your false personality, the more you will remember yourself. What prevents self-remembering is, first of all, false personality. It cannot and does not wish to remember itself, and it does not wish to let any other personality remember. It tries in every possible way to stop self-remembering, takes some form of sleep and calls it self-remembering. Then it is quite happy. You must not trust your false personality its ideas, its words, its actions. You cannot destroy it, but you can make it passive for some time and then, little by little, you can make it weaker.</p>
 <p>Q. You say one must not trust anything connected with false personality, but it seems to be all there is?</p>
 <p>A. It cannot be so. There is one thing - you, and there are imaginary 'I's. You is what really is, and you must learn to distinguish it. It maybe very small, very elementary, but you should be able to find something sufficiently definite and solid in yourself. If we are entirely false personality, then nothing happens. There are people who are only false personality. Other sides of them are so subdued, so weak, that they cannot resist false personality. These people will not study themselves because they would be afraid of seeing what they are. False personality does not like it at all. Generally, if they begin, they very soon leave off, explain it in someway, for they are unable to continue
 self-study. But if one has the energy to go on studying false personality, this shows that one has something besides it. As I said before, this work is every day, not once a month or once a year. It is an examination every day.</p>

<p> Q. Would you say false personality is more inclined to leave you as you grow older?</p>
<p> A. No. If you do nothing against it, it grows. Tastes may change, but it grows. This is the only 'development' that happens in mechanical life. False personality is the most mechanical part of us so mechanical that there is no hope for it. So it must not be allowed to enter into the work.</p>

<p> Q. Presumably really great people, the saints for instance, conquer false personality?</p>
<p>A. It depends on the degree. Saints describe the devils they have to struggle with. All devils live in false personality.</p>

<p> Q. How can I remember my realization that much of emotional suffering is in false personality?</p>
<p>A. Only by self-remembering. Suffering is the best possible help for self-remembering if you learn how to use it. By itself it does not help; one can suffer one's whole life and it will not give a grain of result, but if one learns to use suffering, it will become helpful. The moment you suffer, try to remember yourself.</p>

<p>Q. There are two kinds of suffering: one is due to seeing my own mechanicalness and weakness, and the other is suffering from seeing someone you are fond of ill or unhappy. How to work against it or use it for the work?</p>
<p> A. The question is, can you do something or not? If you can, you can, but if you cannot, it is another thing. If we begin suffering about everything we cannot help, then we shall certainly never cease suffering. The chief thing is to find how much imagination there is in it. We may be perfectly sure there is none, but if we make one more effort we often see that it is all imaginary. We have a wrong picture of ourselves, and at the same time we ascribe to this wrong picture real features. But if this picture is false, then everything about it is bound to be false, and its suffering is also false. It maybe very acute, but this does not make any difference. Imaginary suffering is generally more unpleasant than real, because with real suffering you can do something, but with imaginary suffering you can do nothing. You can only get rid of it, but if you are fond of it or proud of it, then you have to keep it.</p>

<p> Q. I still do not see how to start understanding false personality?</p>
<p> A. You must know what it is, place it, so to speak; this is the first step. You must realize that all identification, all considering, all lies, all lies to oneself, all weaknesses, all contradictions, whether seen or unseen, all these are false personality. It is like a special breed of dog. If you do not know it, you cannot speak about it. Even to see little bits of it is quite enough, for every small part of it is the same colour. If you see this dog once, you will always know it. It barks in a special way, walks in a special way.. . .In the beginning you cannot know which is 'I'and which is false personality. What you call 'I' is a complicated structure, and so is false personality. You cannot know everything about either of them; but if you take from one side something you have no doubt about that it is false and from the other side something you have no doubt about that it is true, you can compare them.</p>

<p> Q. Sometimes I observe myself identifying or considering and find that I do so because of a picture I have of myself. Can I in this way come to know false personality and, by observing it, weaken it?</p>
<p>A. Yes, it is the only way, but only if you do not get tired of it, because, in the beginning, many people start eagerly, but soon get tired and begin to use 'I' indiscriminately without asking themselves 'which I'? Our chief enemy is the word 'I', because, as I said, we have really no right to use it in ordinary conditions. Much later, after long work, we can begin to think of the group of 'I's that correspond to Deputy Steward as 'I'. But in ordinary conditions, when you say 'I don't like', you must ask yourself, 'Which of my "I"s does not like?' In this way you constantly remind yourself of this plurality. If you forget once, it will be easier to forget next time. There are many good beginnings in the work, and then, after some time, this is forgotten and people start to slide down, and in the end become more mechanical than before. The beginning of self-knowledge is understanding who speaks in you and whom you can trust.</p>

<p> Q. Does one's capacity forwork increase just as much as one is able to weaken false personality?</p>
<p> A. Work begins with struggle against false personality. Everything one can get one gets only at the expense of false personality. Later, when it is made passive, one may get much at the expense of other things, but for a long time one has to live, so to speak, off false personality. False personality is very difficult to find in ordinary life, because, since there is no action against it, there is also no resistance. But when a person begins to work, resistance to work appears, and this resistance is false personality.</p>

<p> Q. Cannot false personality be interested in, or attracted by, system ideas?</p>
<p> A. Yes, very much. Only then you will have the system in the light of false personality, and it will be quite a different system. The moment false personality takes the system to itself it only grows stronger and weakens the system for you. It adds one word here and another there, and you cannot imagine in what an extraordinary form some of the ideas come back to me. One word omitted from some formulation may make an idea quite different. False personality always knows better and is always fully justified in doing what it likes. This is where the danger lies. The system means all that is said, in the sense in which it is said. If one corrects it, consciously or unconsciously, then it cannot be called the system - it will be pseudo system, falsification of the system. The moment it becomes incorrect or something is forgotten or left out, it will give wrong results.</p>

<p> Q. I ask these questions because I sometimes doubt the genuineness of my interest in the work I may be lying to myself.</p>
<p> A. Only you can answer that; and there again only if you do not forget the fundamental principles and say 'I' about something which is only one of the'I's. You must get to know other 'I's and remember about them. To forget about this is very dangerous, because then a knock, a slight change in something can be enough to put everything wrong. Until now, when we spoke about man, we spoke about general human features common to all people. But at a certain moment in the work, besides understanding the general principles, one must try to find one's own peculiarities, for one cannot know oneself for practical purposes if one only knows the general characteristics. Each man has his own individual features, his own weaknesses when he is unable to resist things that happen. These features or weaknesses may be very simple or very complicated. One man may be able to resist everything except good food; another all except talk, or he may be lazy, or too active. It is very important at a certain stage of self-study to find one's chief feature, which means chief weakness. People's chief weaknesses are very different, and if we can resist something that another man cannot resist because it happens to be his chief feature, this difference in weaknesses gives us the illusion that we can 'do'. Chief feature or chief weakness is in false personality. In some cases it is possible to see definitely one, two or three features or tendencies, often linked together, which come into everything like an axis around which everything turns. This is chief feature. Sometimes it is very clear and apparent, but sometimes it is difficult to describe. Our language has often no words, no forms to describe it and it can only be indicated in a roundabout way. It is interesting that one can hardly ever find one's own chief feature, because one is in it, and if one is told, one usually does not believe it. But we can find what stands side by side with it, although it is not it. It is sometimes useful to collect opinions of friends about oneself,for this helps in discovering one's features. It is very important to find out what creates obstacles to our work. Until one has found it, a chief feature means constant loss of energy, so we must find this leak and stop it.</p>

<p> Q. Can one ever find the chief feature by oneself?</p>
<p> A. At a certain moment in organized work it will come out, or you may be told. But if you are told, you will not believe it. Or sometimes it is so obvious that it is impossible to deny it, but with the help of buffers one can forget it again. I have known people who gave a name to their chief feature and for some time remembered it, and then forgot. You must come near to it yourself. When you feel it yourself, you will know. If you are only told, you may easily forget. When you find many manifestations of your false personality, you may find your feature.</p>

<p> Q. Is it what you call a buffer?</p>
<p> A. No, but buffers hide the chief feature; it is helped by buffers.</p>
<p>Q. If we find out our chief features, can we correct them? You said we cannot change anything.</p>
<p>A. In the ordinary way we cannot. But here it means using the result of experience and knowledge that does not belong to ordinary life.</p>

<p> Q.But an ordinary man changes too.</p>
<p> A. Of course he changes, he becomes more mechanical, more narrow, more set. There may be exceptions, but as a rule things do not progress in ordinary life. Personalities change, particularly if circumstances change, but it is mechanical, accidental change. We often base our opinion on exceptions, whether we observe them rightly or wrongly. Exceptions are easier to notice than rules.</p>

<p> Q. Having observed a certain tendency in oneself, one decides that it shall not happen.</p>
<p> A. Usually after one has decided it still goes on happening. Or if it does not happen, generally another tendency appears in its place. As a rule only one thing stops things - fear.</p>

<p> Q. Do chief features vary during life?</p> features vary during life?</p>
<p> A. If they are clearly delineated, they go on throughout the whole life.</p>

<p> Q. Yet I can see things that I had that do not exist now.</p>
<p> A. Possibly. Our knowledge of ourselves is very defective. One can observe many things in life and make great mistakes, if one does not know how to verify. And generally, as I said, it is difficult to see chief feature.</p>

<p> Q. Could you tell me what my chief feature is?</p>
<p> A. I do not think so. You see, this is not necessary for starting to work. In the beginning, what is important is not the chief feature itself but what is produced by it, and that you can study in the form of attitudes. We do not know our attitudes because we have never thought about ourselves in the right way. We have too many imaginary ideas. What we must study now is all our points of view, habitual emotions, the way we think, what we invent. These are all results of chief feature or chief features, for there may be two or three features which are the most important, not necessarily only one. Think about false personality; this is quite sufficient for practical purposes. As a theory, false personality in most cases turns round one axle and that axle is chief feature. If a man has one big weakness, from one point of view it is an advantage, because if he can conquer this feature or weakness he can in one stride achieve many
 things. It is an advantage when things are concentrated, many things coming together at one point. Then efforts at this point produce better results than if one works at different points. But chief feature is not always definable. Sometimes you can put your finger on it, sometimes not; in one person you can see it, in another not. But false personality you can see.</p>

<p> Q. Is chief featurea food for false personality?</p>
<p> A. Chief feature is not food. It is false personality; it is something on which false
 personality is based and which enters into everything.</p>

<p> Q. Does chief feature always make decisions at important moments?</p>
<p> A. This is the best definition for it that it always makes decisions. In connection with chief feature, it is better to think first on general lines why you came to the system, what you want from the system. It often happens that people come to lectures for years and forget why they came. If you remember why you came, the system can answer your questions, but not without that. You may not remember about mechanicalness; you may forget about the very keen conviction in every person that he can 'do', and that if he cannot it is because he did not think about it or did not wish to. It is necessary to struggle with this idea, and understand that we are mechanical, that we can do nothing, that we are asleep, that we have many 'I's all these things. This will help you to see false personality, for all these things we ascribe to ourselves are standard examples of imagination. And imaginary personality, or false personality,
 is chief feature for everybody.</p>

<p> Q. Is false personality always selfish?</p>
<p> A. If you think of yourself as false personality and try to find what is not, you may be fairly sure that all that is selfish is false personality. But the more you think about it, the less you will see it. It may appear very unselfish, and that is the worst of all!</p>
 <p>Q. Are there many varieties of chief feature?</p>
 <p>A. There are strange varieties and there are classical ones. One very common feature, described in many places in the New Testament, is when we see other people's faults but not our own. Then certain kinds of self-pity are very common. And there are also curious combinations for which it is sometimes difficult to find a psychological definition.</p>

<p> Q. Is self-remembering the only way to defeat chief feature?</p>
<p> A. Without self-remembering we can do nothing. It is the only way.</p>

 <p>Q. Is it not possible to have different features when one is with different people?</p>
<p>A. No, these are roles. Features do not change so quickly.</p>

<p> Q. Is blaming other people a feature?</p>
<p> A. It may be a feature. But what is it based on? On lack of understanding. If you begin to study psychology, you find that all causes are in yourself; there can be no causes outside yourself. You do not remind yourself of this often
 enough. One little part understands that causes are in you, but the larger part continue to accuse other people. At the bottom of every favourite negative emotion you will find self-justification which feeds it. You must stop it in your mind first, and then after some time you will be able to stop it in the emotion too. Lack of understanding is the first cause, lack of effort the second.</p>

<p> Q. Did you say that laziness can be a chief feature?</p>
<p> A. Laziness is for some people three-quarters of their lives or more. Sometimes laziness is very important and is the chief feature of false personality, and then all the rest depends on laziness and serves laziness. But you must remember that there are different kinds of laziness. It is necessary to find these different kinds by observing yourself and observing other people. For instance, there are very busy people who are always doing something, and yet their mind may be lazy. This happens more often than anything else. Laziness is not only desire to sit and do nothing.</p>

<p> Q. What is the best way to struggle with false personality?</p>
<p> A. Always do something which false personality does not like and very soon you will find more things it does not like. If you continue, it will get more and more irritated and will show itself more and more clearly, so that soon there will be no question about it. But first your struggle must be based on knowing you must know its features, find what it particularly dislikes. One false personality dislikes one thing, another dislikes another thing. You must hav enough strength in yourself to go against it. Now let us speak about the relation of false personality to other parts of man. In every man, at every moment, his development proceeds by what maybe called a Static Triad. This triad can be called static because things at the apex of the triangle always stay in the same place and act as neutralizing force while the other forces change very slowly. Man is divided into four parts: body, soul, essence and personality. We have already spoken about essence and personality. The term 'soul' is used in the system in the sense of life-principle. The soul may be described as a cloud of fine matters or energies connected together and bound to the physical body. As long as it is in the body, the body is alive and body and soul make one thing. When they separate, we say that the body dies. It is this that distinguishes a piece of dead meat from living flesh. When a centre is working well, the soul is concentrated there. But in an ordinary man the soul has no psychic qualities, nor is it any use your knowing anything more about it. I only tell you this from a theoretical point of view; it is simply material, although of a finer materiality than the body. This diagram may be useful, because it shows what we are, if we can see it. It shows the changes in our development, what we are now and what we can become. When you learn to use this diagram, it will help you to determine definite stages in the work. The first triangle shows the state of man in ordinary life; the second shows his state when he begins to develop. There are long periods between the state shown in the first and the state shown in the second triangle and still longer between them and the third triangle. Actually there are many intermediate stages, but these three are sufficient to show the way of development in relation to false personality. It is necessary to remember that none of these states is permanent. Any of them may last for half an hour and then another state may come, then again a different state. The diagram only shows how development goes. It would be possible to continue the diagram beyond permanent 'I', because permanent 'I' again has many forms. The triad is made by the body, the soul and the essence at the apex. At the second point is 'I', taken in the sense of many 'I's which are the person, that is to say, all feelings and sensations which do not form a part of false personality. The third point of the triangle is held by false personality, that is, by the imaginary picture of oneself.
 In an ordinary man false personality calls itself 'I' and is active, but after some time, if a man is capable of development, magnetic centre begins to grow in him. He may call it 'special interests', 'ideals', 'ideas' or something like that. When he begins to feel this magnetic centre, he finds a separate part in himself, and from this part his growth begins. This growth can take place only at the expense of false personality, because false personality cannot appear at the same time as magnetic centre. When magnetic centre is active, false personality is passive, but when false personality is active, magnetic centre is passive. If magnetic centre is formed in a man, he may meet a school, and when he begins to work he must work against false personality. This does not mean that false personality disappears; it only means that it is not always present. In the beginning it is nearly always present, but when magnetic centre begins to grow it disappears, sometimes for half an hour, sometimes even for a day. Then it comes back and stays for a week! When false personality disappears for a short time, 'I' becomes stronger, only it is not really 'I', it is many 'I's. The longer the periods for which false personality disappears, the stronger the 'I' composed of many 'I's becomes. Magnetic centre maybe transformed into Deputy Steward, and when Deputy Steward acquires control of false personality it transfers all the unnecessary things to the side of false personality, and only the necessary things remain on the side of 'I'. Then, at a still further stage, it may be that permanent 'I' will come on the side of the 'I' side with all that belongs to it. Then many 'I's will be on the false personality side, but we cannot say much about that now. There will be permanent 'I' with all that belongs to it, but we do not know what belongs to it. Permanent 'I' has quite different functions, quite a different point of view from anything we are accustomed to. The name 'permanent I' is not very successful, because it is not permanent for a long time; it only comes and stays when it is necessary, and when it is not necessary it may go away again. So it is better to say 'real I'. When this 'I' comes, it controls all other 'I's. It can control everything in a way that no existing 'I's can, so it is quite new in a sense. But when this one 'I' comes, it does not mean that it will stay. First it may not be necessary for it to be there, because smaller 'I's must also learn to act in the right way. Secondly it needs very intensive work, and if work slackens it cannot stay. So there are many conditions for its presence, but if you experience the taste of it being there once, you will know many things and you will be sure of many things which now you can only surmise. The Static Triad shows that either personal work or degeneration is going on in relation to different manifestations of false personality, but that body, soul and essence remain the same all the time. After some time they too will be affected, but they do not enter into the initial stages. Body will remain the same body, essence will change later, but it does not enter into the beginning of the work. According to this system, essence enters only as much as it is mixed with personality. We do not take it separately because, as already explained, we have no means of working on essence apart from personality.</p>

<p>Q. Does this diagram imply that body and essence come in sometimes on the side of false personality, and sometimes on the other, according to which is uppermost?</p>
<p>A. No. If body and essence are normal, they are impartial and do not take one side or the other. But if there is something wrong with them, they are on the side of false personality. But that does not enter into our conversation; we take them as a permanent force. Change takes place at the other two points of the triad.</p>

<p> Q. Does this diagram mean that Deputy Steward begins to take the place of magnetic centre when one starts school work?</p>
<p> A. As I have explained earlier, Deputy Steward does not come straight from magnetic centre, it has to be transformed into different things first. The first thing that shows the right growth of something in the place of magnetic centre is valuation - understanding of the work. There is a long way between the one and the other. In the diagram they are shown to follow one another, but it does not mean that the one follows the other immediately they are miles and miles apart and there are hundreds of transformations.</p>

<p>Q. What is it that makes 'I' begin to develop and false personality to fade?</p>
<p>A. All changes happen in time. In ordinary life false personality is there the whole time. Then, in time, it will diminish and become less important, will occupy less time. (This is shown in the second stage of the diagram where false personality has become passive and the many 'I's surrounding magnetic centre have become active.) You cannot diminish false personality in the sense of size, but you can diminish it in the sense of time. Take twenty-four hours how many hours belong to one and how many to the other? Everything that changes in us changes in this way.</p>

<p>Q. I had the impression until now that false personality was the collection of all the many 'I's. This diagram has made things a little obscure to me.</p>
<p> A. Among these many 'I's there are some useful and many passive 'I's which maybe the beginning of other personalities. False personality cannot develop; it is all wrong. That is why I said that all work must be against false personality. If one fails in one's work, it is because one has not given enough attention to false personality, has not studied it, has not worked against it. False personality is also made up of many 'I's, but they are all imaginary.</p>

<p>Q. I do not understand what you mean by passive 'I's.</p>
<p> A. Passive 'I's are 'I's which are controlled by other, active 'I's. For instance, good intentions may be controlled by laziness. Laziness is active, good intentions are passive. The 'I' or combination of 'I's in control is active;the 'I's which are controlled or driven are passive. Understand it quite simply. This diagram represents a state, then a slightly different state and again a different state. With the help of this diagram you can see three different states of man beginning from the most elementary. In the most elementary state false personality is active and 'I' is passive. Body, soul and essence always remain neutralizing. When, after many stages, permanent 'I' comes, the 'I' becomes active, many'I's become passive and false personality disappears. Many different diagrams can be drawn between these two extremes, and further than that there are several possibilities.</p>

<p>Q. Is there a place in the Static Triad where a group of 'I's, unconnected with magnetic centre, are active and false personality is passive?</p>

<p> A. When I said that certain groups of 'I's or personalities become active, I meant those that are centred round magnetic centre. First magnetic centre itself, and then those 'I's that range themselves round magnetic centre are opposed to false personality. Then, at a certain moment, magnetic centre becomes active and false personality passive. Magnetic centre is a combination of a certain group of interests or likes. It does not lead you, for leading would mean progress, whereas you remain in one place. But when things come, then with the help of magnetic centre you are able to see which is which, or whether you like or dislike a thing. You can make a choice. Before one comes into the work, magnetic centre is a certain point which has transformed itself into a certain group of interests. When one meets the work, it becomes interested in school work, and then it disappears as magnetic centre, because magnetic centre is a weak thing, and becomes transformed into what may be called 'work' personality. This diagram is intended to describe the initial stages of the work and so I have put in very few of the combinations which might be shown. For instance, at one of the initial stages we can draw a triad with body, soul and essence at the apex, false personality on one side and many 'I's already divided into certain groups on the other. One of these groups is magnetic centre, but there are other groups, may be not attached, but still not hostile to the magnetic centre, which can exist and eventually develop into something better. The groups of 'I's which are always hostile and always harmful are false personality.</p>

<p> Q. Does the change from one form of the Static Triad to another depend on change of being?</p>
<p> A. Yes, every small change is change of being although this expression is generally applied to bigger, more serious changes. When we speak about change of being we speak about change from men No. 1, 2 and 3 to man No. 4 for instance. This is change of being, but of course this big jump consists of small jumps. The Static Triad is merely an auxiliary diagram. It represents you. It shows the state of your being, what you are at a given moment, and helps you to describe to yourself all the stages you pass through from ordinary mechanical existence to development. In this way you do not describe it in words but give a complete picture of it. Our aim is to become one, to have one permanent 'I'. But in the beginning work means to become more and more divided. You must realize how far you are from being one, and only when you know all these fractions of yourself can work begin on one or some principal 'I's around which unity can be built. It would be wrong understanding to unify all the things you find in yourself now. The new 'I' is something you do not know at present; it grows from something you can trust. At first, in separating false personality from you, you try to divide yourself into what you can call reliable and what you find unreliable. When in a state of doubt remember to try and bring up other 'I's which have a certain valuation. This is the only way to conquer doubts. In order to develop you
 must have some capacity for valuation. The only practical approach is to think of the different sides of yourself and to find the sides that can work and the sides that cannot. Some people have real values, some have false values and somehave no values at all. It is the same with 'I's. People can spend their lives studying systems and system words and never come to real things. Three-quarters or nine-tenths of our ordinary knowledge does not really exist: it exists only in imagination. But this work must be practical from the first. You must understand that without work, without the system, one can do nothing. If one begins to work, one has a chance. But even in the work there are dangers, for if
 people think that they can do something and at the same time refuse to work on acquiring control, if they remain theoretical too long and do not realize that no kind of change is possible without big efforts, if they go on putting off these efforts until tomorow, then this continual hesitation begins to produce an effect and, after some time, there comes a dangerous moment. It does not come in the beginning, but only if for a long time one goes on without making sufficient efforts or without doing anything seriously. Then, instead of one, one can become split into two, so that all features and all personalities are divided into two groups one part useful to the work and helping personal work and another part indifferent or even unfriendly. These two groups can continue to exist side by side, trying not to come up at the same time; one may come in the morning, the other in the afternoon. This is a real danger, because if two parts begin to form like this, the indifference of one spoils the result of the work of the other and in this way development stops. This second part need not necessarily be bad or antagonistic to the work, but only weak, and weakness and strength cannot grow at the same time. So it is necessary to struggle very quickly and ruthlessly against that, otherwise it may lead to double crystallization.</p>

<p>Q. Would one know if these two groups of personalities were forming in one?</p>
<p>A. If one learns to observe oneself, one can find when it begins to happen, and then one must not let it go on for too long, because it will become everyday more and more difficult to struggle with it. But it manifests itself differently in different cases.</p>

<p>Q. Is that a case of acquiring a lot of knowledge without understanding?</p>
<p>A. No. Even understanding is possible in such a case, only without action. You see, even knowledge and understanding cannot help if one does not work on being. If will does not grow at the same time, one can understand and not be able to do anything. If people wait too long without making serious efforts or serious decisions, they may have the beginning of this double crystallization. Then they can get no results in their work, and after a time they may even get wrong results.<p>

<p>Q. How can we learn to love our enemies?</p>
<p> A. Learn to love yourself first you do not love yourself enough; you love your false personality, not yourself.</p>

<p> Q. What are our greatest difficulties?</p>
<p> A. Absence of understanding and slowness of understanding, because understanding generally comes about two years behind time. Another principle I have already spoken about and which must be remembered is that work does not wait, it does not remain the same. One year has certain requirements, the next year something else is required, and so it goes on. And generally it happens that people are ready for the requirements of two years ago. People who wish to continue must raise their standard; and this must not be done at my suggestion: you must think for yourselves in what sense and in what form the standard should be raised. You must think about details things which, to begin with, were only advised, must now become rules for you (but not in the sense of 'school-rules', using the word 'school' in its ordinary meaning). The necessity must be understood. We have come to the stage when we must be serious, and this means self-limitation, limiting false personality. Freedom of'I' depends on limiting false personality; both cannot be free together, one or another must be sacrificed. We must always remember the starting-point, remember that it is connected not simply with words but with search for the miraculous. The system would have no meaning if there were no search for the miraculous.</p>
<p> For instance, I am surprised that you do not ask more questions about separation between 'I' and (for me) 'Ouspensky', because there must be many things that are not clear for you yet. In speaking, in writing, in thinking about the work or the people in the work one must always ask oneself 'Who is speaking?' 'Who is writing?' 'Who is thinking?' If you do that, then, after a little time you will be able to distinguish who is speaking and will begin to recognize the different voices. You must know your false personality and find its features, its faces, manifestations and voices. You must know what it consists of. Sometimes you can actually hear when false personality speaks. It is not much use going on without that, for you will only go on turning round and round in the same circle and always returning to the same spot. When you can be sure that it is really 'you', you can speak. You must already know and mistrust your false personality.</p>

<p> Q. If we do this, will it increase our progress in the work?</p>
<p> A. Nothing can be guaranteed. It should be important to do that without a question of future reward, because the idea of separation is sufficiently important in itself.</p>

<p> Q. How can I put more pressure into my work to wake up my desire to fight false personality?</p>
<p> A. Catch a moment when your false personality wants to do something or does not want to do something, and stop her. When you find a conflict between you and her, it will depend on you how you will act. If she starts fighting, this creates an emotional storm. If there is no fight, emotions are asleep. All things come through friction, friction between the place where 'I' can grow and false personality. Work on oneself begins from the moment one feels this division between what one trusts in oneself and what one cannot trust. What one can trust is entirely created by work. Before, it was just an empty place, but if one begins to work, something begins to solidify. But, I repeat, one can know it better and trust it more only if one knows one's false personality, otherwise false personality will mix with it and pretend to be real'I', or the beginning of real 'I'.</p>

<p> Q. Is false personality a kind of mask?</p>
<p> A. People wear one or another kind of mask and believe that they are exactly like this mask when in reality they are quite different. Each of us has several masks, not one. Observe your own masks and other people's masks. Try to realize that in different  circumstances you have different masks and notice how you change them, how you prepare them and so on. Everybody has masks, but begin with your own. We never study masks, so we must study them; it is very useful. Very often we begin to acquire masks at a very early age; even as school-children we wear one mask with one teacher and another mask with another teacher.</p>

<p> Q. Is it a kind of self-protection, or is it imitation?</p>
<p> A. It is a kind of self-protection, and yet not only that. Sometimes, as you say, it has to do with imitation. You can see fifty or sometimes five hundred people wearing the same mask.</p>

<p> Q. If you took off the mask, what would you find underneath?</p>
<p> A. It is not so easy. You will find that behind this mask there is another mask. Or, if you do not work, it cannot be taken off it grows to the face. But if you work, this mask is not necessary at all and, without it, life becomes much easier there is less lying.</p>

<p> Q. Isn't a mask sometimes an ideal which one lives up to? Sometimes it makes you appear better than you really are.</p>
<p> A. Sometimes better. That is why I said it is not only a protection. You see, we want to know ourselves. When we find something in ourselves that we do not know, we have to study it. We think we know ourselves, and now we find that all we know is masks, and that masks change. What they are, how they come, what their purpose is - that is another question. We have to study masks themselves, not the theory of masks. We always try to escape into theories, theories are safe.</p>

<p> Q. Is it possible to see false personality as a whole?</p>
<p> A. It is possible, but not at once. It is necessary to work, to study it in yourself and in other people, then, little by little, you will see it as a whole, but for a long time you will see it only from one side or another side. Even that is better than nothing. But you must realize and never forget that it is there. That is the first aim of schools. If false personality remains on top, you cannot have anything - it will take everything to itself.</p>

<p> Q. About different voices, I notice that my voice changes with different emotions and different people.</p>
<p> A. Who has ears to hear can hear many changes of voice. Every centre, every part of centre, every part of a part of centre has a different voice. But few people have ears to hear them. For those who can hear it is easy to distinguish many things. For instance, if you speak the truth it is one voice, if you lie it is another voice, if you base things on imagination, yet another. It is quite unmistakable.</p>

<p> Q. Do you mean the intonation?</p>
<p> A. Yes, and also the actual sound of the voice. If you train yourself to listen, the emotional centre can hear the difference.</p>

<p> Q. You spoke about the possibility of a wrong separation. What did you mean by that?</p>
<p> A. Suppose I call everything I like 'I' and everything I dislike 'Ouspensky', it would be a wrong separation. The 'I' from which I observe is a point, it has no material existence yet, it is only the embryo from which 'I' can grow. If I give it material existence, it would be wrong.</p>

<p> Q. Should not some weight be given to it?</p>
<p> A. Yes, but only in relation to the work. Who remembers the aim, who wants to work is 'I', the rest is 'Ouspensky'.</p>

<p> Q. I feel I have nothing in me I can trust. If I get a moment of understanding, false personality seems to take it and the part of me that understood is gone. What can I trust?</p>
<p> A. This feeling that one cannot trust oneself comes at different moments in the work as a delusion, as an excuse, or it comes in the real form. But this is later on, at present it is realization of mechanicalness. For work, a certain time and a certain persistence are necessary. Now you must do what you can, with time you will be able to measure the results of your work.</p>

<p> Q. If work against false personality is a process, does it mean that one can go up and down?</p>
<p> A. Yes, and you must understand in yourself the power and magnitude of false personality, then you will understand that very often people have nothing else, or even if they have some possibility it is quite outweighed by false personality. False personality decides everything. In ordinary life false personality controls every moment, except perhaps moments when one reads or thinks of something. But when one works and magnetic centre begins to grow, sometimes it happens that false personality may disappear for ten or fifteen minutes and give magnetic centre a chance to manifest itself. That is how false personality disappears. It does not entirely disappear, it just goes away for a time. This is what we must try to do - to make it disappear for a time.</p>

<p> Q. Is it only by separation that one can work on identification?</p>
<p> A. Only. Without realizing the difference between 'I' and false personality all efforts only strengthen the weaker side. As I said, this separation is the basis of all work on oneself. Unless this idea is understood, nothing can be attained, in everything one must
 start from that. This is the real difference between people in the work and not in the work. People who are not in the work think that they are what they are. People in the work already understand that they are not what they seem to be. This separation must pass through many phases, but it must begin.</p>

<p> Q. When I see what a balloon of false personality I am, is the thing to do to try and see how I got that way?</p>
<p> A. You have to study yourself. Only one thing can help and change your position and that is getting to know yourself better. This implies many things. There are different degrees and depths of realization and understanding. When one understands sufficiently one will do something, one will not be able to sit and let things go on by themselves. Try to make your question more concrete: what is it you have been trying to do and what do you find you cannot? Then we can discuss it. Maybe you begin from the wrong thing, in a wrong way.
<p> Q. Since I have no permanent 'I', if I try not to identify with one'I', do I identify with another?</p>
<p> A. You must understand that you were given certain ideas in the same way as Mr. Gurdjieff explained them, that is, gradually, first giving one aspect of an idea and then another. Many things are explained first in an elementary way, and then more details are added. When we speak of a man who is not in the work, we say he has no 'I'. If a man starts to study and make efforts, this already means a certain state; he has magnetic centre, and magnetic centre is the beginning of 'I'. So he no longer has the right to say that he has no 'I'. Naturally, he cannot say that he has a complete and permanent 'I', but he must already have a line of action, and this must mean an 'I'. It is not yet fully conscious, but it grows.</p>

<p> Q. What are the kind of things to look for in trying to separate false personality from the rest of oneself?</p>
<p> A. It is necessary to understand the features of false personality what makes it up. You may be able to see it in the glimpses you remember of the age to which you can attribute the beginning of false personality. There are two things that are permanent in us buffers and weaknesses or features of false personality. Every one has one, two or three particular weaknesses, and everybody has certain buffers that are especially important, for they enter into all his decisions and his understanding of things. This is all that is permanent in us, and it is lucky for us that there is nothing more permanent, because these things can be changed. Buffers are artificial, they are not organic, they are chiefly acquired by imitation. Children begin to imitate grown-ups and create buffers, and some others are unwittingly created by education. Features or weaknesses can sometimes be found out, and if one knows a feature and keeps it in mind, one may find certain moments when one can act not from this feature. Everybody has many features but two or three are
 particularly important because they enter into every subjectively important situation in one's life; everything passes through them, all perceptions and all reactions. It is very difficult to realize what this means because we are so accustomed to it that we do not
 notice it; we are too much in those features, we have not got enough perspective.</p>

<p> Q. How can it be weakness if there is no not-weakness?</p>
<p> A. It means mechanicalness. We are mechanical in all things, but in one or two things we are particularly mechanical and particularly blind; that is why they are chief weaknesses, for we cannot see them. Other things, that are not weaknesses, we can see.</p>

<p> Q. What would you call a weakness? Do you judge by ethical standards?</p>
<p> A. No. As I said, a weakness is a thing in which you are most mechanical. Naturally, things concerning which you are absolutely helpless, where you are most asleep, most blind are bound to be your chief weaknesses, because there are degrees in everything. If there were no degrees in our qualities and manifestations it would be very difficult to study. We can study ourselves only because of these degrees. Even features are not always the same; sometimes they are more definitely expressed, and sometimes, in rare cases, they show themselves to us a little, and only in that way can they be found. But features are difficult to see in oneself. You will realize better what being more mechanical and less mechanical means if we take another example, say illness. If we are ill, we become at once more mechanical; we cannot resist the external world and things in it even as much as we resist them ordinarily.</p>

<p> Q. You say we have nothing but weaknesses. Surely desire to be free is not a weakness?</p>
<p> A. There can be one or another kind of desire. Suppose one realizes one's weakness and wishes to get rid of it, and at the same time one does not wish to learn the methods of getting rid of this weakness. This would be a second weakness, helping and protecting the first weakness.</p>

<p> Q. But if one makes constant efforts?</p>
<p> A. Again, that will belong to the other side of you, to what I call 'you'. This 'you' is not a power or a force, it is merely a combination of certain desires, desires to get rid of something. If you realize that something is wrong, and you formulate a desire to get rid of it, then if you can keep your mind on it sufficiently long, it becomes a certain plan of action; and if this line of action is sufficiently prolonged it can attain results. Only, it is necessary to add again that several different lines of action are needed to attain results, not just one line. We have to work at the same time on one thing and another thing and a third thing. If we work on one line we will get nowhere.</p>

<p> Q. Are not the most dangerous negative emotions jealousy, fear, hate, anger?</p>
<p> A. No, this is a wrong classification. The most useful classification is by the degree of identification, for it does the most harm. You take these as negative emotions of the first degree, but it is not necessarily true. For some people maybe self-pity is the worst. For another person the worst thing may be the feeling of injustice. You never know which is worst, because it depends on identification and on features, since the capacity to feel certain emotions particularly strongly and identify with them may be the chief feature of false personality. It is different for different people.</p>
<p>Q. Is suffering, apart from physical pain, possible without false personality?</p>
 <p>A. Certainly, but it does not become so insistent. When false personality begins to enjoy it, it becomes dangerous. Most of our suffering depends on identification, and if identification disappears, our suffering disappears too. One must be reasonable, one
 must realize that it is no use suffering if it is possible not to suffer.

      {
        text: `<p> Identification in relation to people takes a special form which is called, in this system, considering. But considering can be of two kinds when we consider other people's feelings, and when we consider our own. Chiefly we consider our own feelings. We consider mostly in the sense that people somehow do not value us enough or do not think about us enough, or are not careful enough about us. We find many words for that. This is a very important facet of identification and it is very difficult to be free from it; some people are fully in its power. In any case, it is important to observe considering. For me personally, in the beginning, the most interesting idea was that of self-remembering. I simply could not understand how people could miss such a thing. All European philosophy and psychology just missed this point. There are traces in older teachings, but they are so well disguised and placed between less important things that you cannot see the importance of the idea. When we try to keep all these things in mind and to observe ourselves, we come to the very definite conclusion that in the state of consciousness in which weare, with all this identification, considering, negative emotions and absence of self-remembering, we are really asleep. We only imagine that we are awake. So when we try to remember ourselves it means only one thing we try to awake. And we do awake for a second but then we fall asleep again. This is our state of being, so actually we are asleep. We can awake only if we correct many things in the machine and if we work very persistently on this idea of awaking, and for a long time.</p>

 <p> Q. It seems to me I cannot study a person without losing myself in him or her, yet I understand that this is wrong?</p>
<p> A. It is a wrong idea that one cannot study a person or anything else without losing oneself. If you lose yourself in anything, you cannot study it. Identifying is always a weakening element: the more you identify the worse your study is and the smaller the results. You may remember that in the first lecture I said that identifying with people takes the form of considering. There are two kinds of considering: internal and external. Internal considering is the same as identifying. External considering needs a certain amount of self-remembering; it means taking into account other people's weaknesses, putting oneself in their place. Often in life it is described by the word 'tact'; only tact may be educated or accidental. External considering means control. If we learn to use it consciously, it will give us a possibility of control.
 Internal considering is when we feel that people do not give us enough, do not appreciate us enough. If one considers internally one misses moments of external considering. External considering must be cultivated, internal considering must be eliminated. But first observe and see how often you miss moments of external considering and what an enormous role internal considering plays in life. Study of internal considering, of mechanicalness, of lying, of imagination, of
 identification shows that they all belong to us, that we are always in these states. When you see this, you realize the difficulty of work on oneself. Such as you are you cannot begin to get something new; you will see that first you must scrub the machine clean; it is too covered with rust. We think we are what we are. Unfortunately we are not what we are but what we have become; we are not natural beings. We are too asleep, we lie too much, we live too much in imagination, we identify too much. We think we have to do with real beings, but in reality we have to do with imaginary beings. Almost all we know about ourselves is imaginary. Beneath all this agglomeration man is quite different. We have many imaginary things we must throw off before we can come to real things. So long as we live in imaginary things, we cannot see the value of the real; and only when we come to real things in ourselves can we see what is real outside us. We have too much accidental growth in us.<p>

<p>Q. If one retired from the world, surely one would overcome identification, considering and negative emotion?</p>
<p> A. This question is often asked, but one<cannot be at all sure that it would beeasier. Besides you can find descriptions in literature of how people attained a very high degree of development in seclusion, but when they came in contact with other people they at once lost all they had gained. In schools of the Fourth Way it was found that the best conditions for study and work on oneself are a man's ordinary conditions of life, because from one point of view these conditions are easier and from another they are the most difficult. So if a man gets something in these conditions he will keep it in all conditions, whereas if he gets it in special conditions he will lose it in other
 conditions.</p>
 <p>Q. Could you, please, say again which is internal and which external considering?</p>
<p> A. External considering is aform of self-remembering in relation to people. You take other people into consideration and do, not what is pleasant to you, but what is plesant to them. It means you must sacrifice yourself, but it does not mean self-sacrifice. It means that in relation to people you must not act without thinking. You must think first, and then act. Your thinking will show you that, more often than not, if this person would prefer you to act in one manner and not in another, it is all the same to you, so why not do what he likes? So the idea of sacrifice does not enter into it. But if it is not the same to you, it is quite a different question. What is better for you, what is better for them, who those people are, what you want from them, what you want to do for them all this must enter into it. But the idea is that in relation to people things must not happen mechanically, without thinking. You must decide your course of action. It means you do not walk over people without seeing them. And internal considering means that you walk over them without noticing. We have too much internal and not enough external considering. External considering is very important for self-remembering. If we have not got enough of it, we cannot remember ourselves.</p>

<p> Q. Is it the same as understanding people?</p>
<p> A. No, you can understand people only as much as you understand yourself. It is understanding their difficulties, understanding what they want, watching the impression you produce on people and trying not to produce a wrong impression.</p>

<p> Q. Would you say that kindness is external considering?</p>
<p> A. What you knew in life is not external considering. It is necessary to understand the principle and create standards for oneself. With the help of external considering you control the impression you wish to produce. With internal considering you wish to produce one impression and produce a different one.</p>

<p> Q. External considering seems to me very far away.</p>
<p> A. It must be here to-day. If it remains far away, you remain far away yourself.</p>

<p> Q. Does external considering involve the ability to play a conscious role?</p>
<p> A. Yes, but there are different degrees. External considering is only the beginning; to play a conscious role means much more.</p>

<p> Q. And what is internal considering?</p>
<p> A. Feeling that people do not pay you enough; making accounts; always feeling cheated, underpaid.</p>

<p> Q. I find it very difficult to stop inner considering. Is there any special technique to be employed against it?</p>
<p> A. No, there is no special technique only understanding and right points of view. Observe more. Perhaps you will find moments free from considering and see how to begin struggling with it and studying it. It is mechanical, a mechanical attitude, the same as identification.</p>

<p> Q. Is self-justification always a manifestation of internal considering?</p>
<p> A. It is connected with it, but it is another thing. Internal considering does not need any justification. One must have a reason for justifying, but if one is in internal considering, one always justifies it. Internal considering
means identification; external considering means struggle with identification. Internal considering is mechanical; external considering means at least attention. So by practising non-identifying, by trying to control attention, you find many opportunities of studying external considering and, if you find examples, perhaps you will find methods of struggling with internal considering and transforming it into the practice of external considering. For instance, you are talking to somebody from whom you want to get something. Say he knows something and you want him to tell you what he knows. Then you must speak in the way he would like, not argue, not oppose him.</p>
 External considering is always practical.</p>

<p> Q. Does inner considering mean considering oneself too much?</p>
<p> A. It always takes the form of inner bargaining, of thinking that other people do not consider you enough. It is very important to understand inner considering. There are so many subtle forms of it we do not notice, and yet our life is filled with it.</p>

<p> Q. Is desire to be noticed considering?</p>
<p> A. Both desire to be and not to be noticed is considering. There are many psychological states that ordinary psychology cannot explain or describe which depend on identifying and considering.</p>

<p> Q. How is it best to think of inner considering?</p>
<p> A. You must try in free moments to have a right mind about it. When you are considering, it is too late. You must think of typical cases of considering, of what produces it, and then have a right point of view about it, realize how useless and ridiculous it is. Then compare it with external considering, and try not to forget it. If you do this you may remember it when a moment of considering comes, and perhaps it will not come. What is really important is to think about considering when you are free from it, and not justify or hide it from yourself.</p>

<p> Q. The more I try to work, the more I seem to consider internally. It seems the most difficult thing to deal with.</p>
<p> A. Considering cannot grow if you work, it only becomes more visible. And that means that it diminishes, for it cannot be seen without it diminishing. The fact that you notice it proves that it has become less strong. This is a natural illusion, the same as when one feels that one does not understand whereas before one understood. This means that one begins to understand. The first doubt about one's understanding already means a certain understanding.</p>

<p> Q. Can one think of identification as a negative state that can only be caused by negative emotions?</p>
<p>A. No, not quite like that. Identification is a necessary element in every negative emotion; you cannot have a negative emotion without identification. So the study of identification and struggle against identification are very powerful weapons in the struggle with negative emotions. Sometimes you cannot struggle with a negative emotion directly, but by trying not to identify you diminish its power, for all the power of negative emotions lies in identification and imagination. So when you separate identification and imagination, the negative emotion practically disappears, or at any rate changes.</p>

<p>Q. So to fight against negative emotions themselves we have to observe more and work against the strong identification with emotions?</p>
<p> A. Yes. Later we will speak about methods of struggling with emotions themselves, because there are many and very definite methods, different for different emotions; but first you must struggle with negative imagination and identification. This is quite sufficient to destroy many of the usual negative emotions in any case, to make them much lighter. You must start with this, because it is only possible to begin using stronger methods when you can struggle with identification to a certain extent, and when you have already stopped negative imagination. That must be stopped completely. It is useless to study further methods until that is done. Negative imagination you can stop; and even the study of identification will already diminish it. You must try to avoid identification as often as you can, not only in relation to negative emotions but in relation to everything. If you create in yourself the capacity of not identifying, that will affect these emotions and you will notice that they begin to disappear. Identification is the atmosphere in which negative emotions live, and they cannot live without it.</p>

<p> Q. Can we have some rules or guidance to keep to in ordinary life conditions?</p>
<p> A. Try to remember yourself, try not to identify. This will immediately produce an effect in ordinary life. What does life consist of? Negative emotions, identifying, considering, lying, sleep. The first point is: how to remember oneself, how to be more aware? And then you will find that negative emotions are one of the chief factors which make us unable to remember ourselves. So one thing cannot go without the other. You cannot struggle with negative emotions without remembering yourself more, and you cannot remember yourself more without struggling with negative emotions. If you remember these two things, you will understand everything better. Try to keep these two ideas, which are connected, in mind.</p>

<p> Q. I had a problem which was worrying me. I tried to self-remember and for a short time I got into a state in which it was no longer possible to worry, and at the same time my sense of values generally changed. This state did not last long, but the problem, when it returned as one, did not again assume the importance it had before. I find it very difficult to recapture this state.</p>

<pp> A. Quite right. Continue to observe and you will find that there is a place in you where you are quiet, calm, and nothing can disturb you - only it is difficult to find the way there. But if you do it several times you will be able to remember some of the steps, and by the same steps you may come there again. Only you cannot do it after one experience, for you will not remember the way. This quiet place is not a metaphor it is a very real thing.</p>

<p> Q. Is it the state you get to when you self-remember, because everything seems peaceful then and one really seems to be aware of oneself?</p>
<p> A. Yes, you can take it like that.</p>

<p> Q. I have tried to reach it again by trying to self-remember, but could not find it.</p>
<p> A. If you find yourself in it again, try to remember how you got there, for sometimes it happens that one finds this place and loses the way there; then again one finds it and again loses the way. It is very difficult to remember the way to this place.</p>`,

    term: "Self-remembering",
    excerpts: [
      {
        text: `<p>There is nothing automatic in self-remembering every moment is effort. If it is sufficiently deep and sufficiently long it is one thing, but if it is just a flash it is not sufficient. Also, if you remember yourself to the exclusion of everything else, it is one thing, and if you remember yourself and at the same time remember your aim and what you are doing, it is another thing. It depends on how much enters into self-remembering.
         For me personally, in the beginning, the most interesting idea was that of self-remembering. I simply could not understand how people could miss such a thing. All European philosophy and psychology just missed this point. There
 are traces in older teachings, but they are so well disguised and placed between less important things that you cannot see the importance of the idea. If you make a serious effort to observe functions for yourself, you will realize that
 ordinarily, whatever you do, whatever you think, whatever you feel, you do not remember yourself. You do not realize that you are present, that you are here. At the same time you will find that, if you make sufficient efforts for a sufficiently long time, you can increase your capacity for self-remembering. You will begin to remember yourself more often, you will begin to remember yourself more deeply, you will begin to remember yourself in connection with more ideas - the idea of consciousness, the idea of work, the idea of centres, the idea of self-study. But the question is how to remember oneself, how to make oneself more aware? The first step is to realize that we are not conscious. When we realize this and observe it for sometime, we must try to catch ourselves at moments when we are not conscious and, little by little, this will make us more conscious. This effort will show how little conscious we are, because in ordinary conditions of life it is very difficult to be conscious. Here you put yourselves in artificial conditions, you think about yourselves 'I am sitting here' or 'I am myself' and even then you cannot do it much.
 But in ordinary conditions when you are thinking about something, or talking, or working, everything distracts you, and you cannot remember yourselves. This expression 'remembering oneself' is taken intentionally, for in ordinary conversation we often say 'he forgot himself' or 'he remembered himself in time'. We use this expression only in relation to extreme forms of negative emotions, but in actual fact we always forget ourselves, and with the exception of very rare moments we never remember ourselves in time.</p>

<p> Q. Is self-remembering the initial process of this system?</p>
<p> A. It is the centre of the initial process, and it has to go on, it must enter into everything. At first this sounds improbable, because you may try to remember yourself, and then you find that for long periods of time it does not come to your mind; then again you begin to remember about it. But efforts of this kind are never lost; something accumulates and at a certain moment when in the ordinary state you would have been completely identified and submerged in things, you find that you can stand aside and control yourself. You never know when it will be or how it comes. You must only do what you can observe yourself, study, and chiefly try to remember yourself; then, at a certain moment, you will see results.</p>

<p> Q. How does one begin to use memory in the sense of self-remembering?</p>
<p> A. Self-remembering is not really connected with memory; it is simply an expression. It means self-awareness, or self-consciousness. One must be conscious of oneself. It begins with the mental process of trying to remember oneself. This capacity to remember oneself must be developed, because in self-observation we must try to study our functions separately from one another - intellectual function separately from the emotional, instinctive separately from moving. This is very important but not easy.</p>

<p>Q. Is it only when one is self-remembering that one can give controlled attention?</p>
<p> A. It is more or less on the same line, but at the same time controlled attention is possible in ordinary life. Sometimes people can control their attention and do interesting work without knowing anything about self-remembering Although controlled attention is very close to self-remembering, there is a difference. Attention can be in only one centre, whereas self-remembering needs the work of three or even four centres.</p>

<p> Q. What do you call a centre of gravity?</p>
<p> A. The idea of centre of gravity can be interpreted in many different ways. It is a more or less permanent aim and the realization of the relative importance of things in connection with this aim. This means that certain interests become more important than anything else one acquires a permanent direction, one does not go one day in one direction and another day in another; one goes in one direction and one knows the direction. The stronger your centre of gravity, the more you are free from accident. When you change your direction every moment, then every moment something new may happen and every accident can turn you one way or another way. But if your intentional activity, such for instance as self-remembering, becomes so definite, so intense and so continual as to leave no place for accidents, accidents will be much less likely to happen, because accidents need space and time. So we have to add more causes which will produce results and in this way simply exclude accident, because the more our time is occupied with conscious work the less room will be left for accidental happenings.</p>

<p> Q. Is there anything in the schools of the Fourth Way equal to prayer state, and if so, does it come with self-remembering?</p>
<p> A. Yes, in all the ways one has to pass through the same experiences, only in a different order. Certainly self-remembering, non-identifying and several other practices will give exactly the same personal sensations as high emotions of a religious or an intellectual order. You remember that man was compared to a house with four rooms. What does development mean? It means working in the four rooms, only the order of rooms in which a man works is different in different ways. In the Fourth Way work is done in all the four rooms at once.</p>

<p>Q. We talk of schools and different levels. Is it not rather confusing? What do higher levels mean?</p>
<p> A. Why do you find the idea of higher levels confusing? For instance, we can take this idea of levels quite simply in relation to ourselves: using all our mental capacities we can think only up to a certain level, but if we could use
 higher centres, for instance higher emotional centre which already needs more or less complete self-remembering, then certainly on the same subject we could think quite differently and find many more connections in things which we do not notice now. That shows different levels of thinking, and sometimes we actually have glimpses of a higher level of thinking, so we may have some material for observation, because even now we can think differently on the same subject.
  
<p> Chapter V</p>

 
<p> IT WOULD BE GOOD IF, FROM TIME TO TIME, you tried to summarize in your mind what you have heard so far; because after some time of coming to lectures and talks one begins to forget the chronology of the ideas, and it is
 important to remember the order in which they are given. Out of all you have heard, the most important idea is that with certain knowledge and certain efforts man can develop, he can complete himself. The development of  man, if it is a process (it is not obligatory at all), passes through certain definite stages or steps. If you return to the beginning, you will remember what was said about the absence of consciousness in man and the fact that when a man realizes it, this realization gives him the possibility of acquiring consciousness, and you will see that this is the direction in which man can develop. As long as he does not realize that he is simply a machine and that all his processes are mechanical, he cannot begin to study himself, for this realization is the beginning of self-study. So study must begin in this way: we must realize that we do not possess self-consciousness, that we cannot be aware of ourselves at moments of action or thought. This is the first step. The second step is to realize that we do not know ourselves, we do not know our machine and how it works. And the next step is to realize that we have to study methods of self
study. We observe ourselves all our life, but we do not know what self-observation means. Real self-observation must be based on facts. So one of the first points is: how to remember oneself, how to be more conscious?
 It is not enough to admit this absence of consciousness in oneself; one has to see it in actual fact, to verify it from personal observation. We do not realize what consciousness is and what it implies. If one becomes conscious for half an hour, it is incredible what one can see and learn. So it is an aim in itself, because of what it brings, and it also means a step towards objective consciousness. It is necessary to speak a little about this, about what is meant by the four degrees of consciousness man can possess. If we take it from the point of view of cognition of truth, then in sleep we cannot know the difference between what is true and what is not true. Things we see in dreams all look alike. In the waking state we already have more opportunity to recognize the difference between things: the shape of things is made out by our eye, the surface of things by touch and, to a certain extent, we can orientate ourselves by the perceptions of our instruments of sense. So there is an objective element, but we ourselves remain subjective to ourselves. When we become self conscious, we become objective to ourselves, and in objective conscious we can know objective truth about everything. These are the degrees of consciousness.</p>

<p> Q. Must we change our knowledge in order to see things as they really are and know the truth?</p>
<p> A. No, in this state of consciousness we cannot come to things as they are; we have to change our state of consciousness. But we can take off some layers of lying. Things are surrounded by lying. We can take off one, two or three skins and come nearer to real things.</p>

<p> Q. I am not clear about higher consciousness. Could we at least know how to think about it?</p>
<p> A. We realize the possibility of higher consciousness when we realize that we are not conscious at all. We are conscious only at rare moments, without possibility of control. Now we are in two states in sleep and half-awake.Theoretical comparisons of states of consciousness and descriptions in words will not help; but when we begin to awake we realize the state in which we are now. It is necessary to find moments of self-remembering and then, at these moments, you will see the difference. By studying yourself you will see that you can be very near to sleep, or you can be near to self-consciousness. So study begins with the study of these different states in ourselves. For instance, when we take ourselves as one or do not think about it then we are nearly asleep. But when we begin to divide ourselves and know that at every moment it is only one'I' or one group of 'I's speaking, then we are nearer to self-consciousness, nearer to objective facts. There are different ways of studying consciousness in oneself. In the beginning the first thing is the realization that one cannot be conscious when one wants to. The best time to realize this is after you have been speaking or doing something. Suppose you have been talking about some important business, or writing a letter; then ask yourself, 'Was I conscious at that time?' The second thing, in the beginning, is the realization that you are not one, that you have many different 'I's.</p>

<p> Q. How is one to recognize when one is self-conscious?</p>
<p> A. You will know; it is quite a different feeling. If you try to be conscious for a moment and then compare it with another moment when you did not try to be conscious, you will see the difference. It cannot be described. One moment you are aware of yourself, another moment you are not: you do things, you speak, you write and you are not conscious. Only you must remember that it is said from the very beginning that we must study not only states of consciousness but also obstacles to consciousness. So we must study them, and then remove them. All these obstacles are in ourselves. External circumstances we cannot change, we have to take them as they are and change inwardly in these circumstances.</p>

<p> Q. If you observe yourself for a moment, are you conscious at that moment?</p>
<p> A. Not necessarily; it maybe quite mechanical. But if you are conscious at the same time that you observe, the line of your attention will resemble two arrows, one showing attention directed on the thing you observe and another on yourself.</p>

<p> Q. I cannot understand the link between self-observation and self-remembering. How to begin, what to do?</p>
<p> A. Self-remembering is an attempt to be aware of yourself. Self-observation is always directed at some definite function: either you observe your thoughts, or movements, or emotions, or sensations. It must have a definite object which you observe in yourself. Self-remembering does not divide you, you must remember the whole, it is simply the feeling of 'I', of your own person. They may come together, particularly at later stages, and then you will be able to do both at the same time observe some thing definite, or recognize manifestations in yourself, and remember yourself; but in the beginning the two things are different. You begin with self-observation that is the normal way and through self-observation you realize that you do not remember yourself. When you realize that, and that at very rare moments you do remember yourself, then any person who is not definitely prejudiced will be able to understand that it is possible to increase these moments of self-remembering. And then you try to do it.</p>

<p> Q. I find it difficult to decide whether I really observe myself or only remember things afterwards.</p>
<p> A. In the beginning there is no particular necessity to worry about which is which; just do what you can, either observe at the moment, or remember it immediately, or remember after some time. But later you will catch particular moments when you can be aware of yourself at the actual moment when things happen. That will be self-remembering.</p>

<p> Q. How do you know of the miraculous results which will follow self-remembering?<p>
<p> A. You see, this is connected with the whole idea of development, with the possibility of changing being. This is one of the first things we must understand: that man is not bound to remain as he is; he can change. There are different degrees of man that can be attained after long and persistent work. If we can be more conscious, this will make higher centres work. The functioning of higher centres will be in many ways miraculous. The idea of self-remembering enters into many systems and school teachings, but it is not in the right place, it is never put first. But this system says that you do not remember yourself and that if you understand that you do not remember
 yourself, you may be able to achieve something. Self-awareness is the greatest change possible, because in ordinary conditions of life nobody is aware of himself, and yet people do not realize this. Everybody sitting here, if they ask themselves sincerely whether they are aware of themselves, will have to answer that they are not. Nobody is aware. The whole idea is to be aware of yourself in this place, at this moment. This is the beginning, for one has to begin somewhere. Later it may take different forms, many other things maybe included in it. Nothing can describe this: it is material for observation and study. Descriptions will not help, one has to practise. Normally nobody remembers himself, nobody is aware of himself. This is the ordinary state of a human being, of a man-machine. But if he knows about it, if he realizes it and thinks about it, it becomes possible. Only, in the beginning self-remembering is very slow in coming and very small, with long lapses of not remembering.</p>

<p> Q. Is the essential feature of a state of self-remembering the ordinary state of alertness of mind?</p>
<p> A. No, you cannot take it like that it is too small. It is a different state, more different from our present state than our present state is from physical sleep; but even comparing sleep with the ordinary state gives you some possibility of understanding the difference. When you are asleep, your world is limited by actual sensations, but when you wake up and find yourself in the objective world (although you see this world in subjective categories) it is much less limited. But when you realize that this is not full awakening, that you are actually less than half-awake, you will understand that if you awake fully you will find yourself in a still richer world and will see and understand many of its characteristics which now pass unnoticed.</p>

<p> Q. I want to know whether self-remembering, at any rate at an early stage, should be expected to consist of a sterile cessation of attention to any-thing other than oneself?<p>
<p> A. At an early stage it can only be a realization that you do not remember yourself. If we realize how little we are aware of ourselves and how tiny the moments are when we are aware, when we remember that and feel that and realize what it means, then we can understand what self-remembering means. If you realize the importance of this fact and all that it implies, it will not be sterile. But if you do not realize it, you are quite right, it will be sterile. Then it will simply be a strange exercise that does not lead anywhere.</p>

<p> Q. Does self-remembering come automatically when you realize that you do not remember yourself?</p>
<p> A.This is self-remembering. You cannot make the next step without realizing where you are. It is the same process, the same thing. The more you realize how unpleasant and dangerous it is to be a machine, the more possibility you have to change.</p>

<p> Q. How?</p>
<p> A. There is always something we can do at certain moments. You must know these moments, and what to do, and how. We are studying doors. Self-remembering is a door. If realization that we do not remember ourselves becomes continuous, then we can remember ourselves. Every day you can find time to realize that you do not remember yourself; this will gradually bring you to self-remembering. I do not mean to remember that you do not remember yourself but to realise it. I repeat, it is not useful to look for definitions, they would only make understanding more difficult. What is really useful for understanding Is comparing the different degrees of consciousness within our ordinary state, for even in our ordinary state of relative consciousness there are different degrees, different levels: we can be nearer to awakening or further from it. We can see such big differences in ourselves, when we really learn to observe, that it will show us the possibilities we have. It is the one unmistakable thing. We are always moving between two shores between sleep and awakening. Moving more towards one shore or more towards the other creates two different possibilities: one is development, the other is decay.</p>

<p> Q. You asked us not to accept anything without questioning it. Have you knowledge that these higher states of consciousness have actually been reached?</p>
<p> A. Oh yes. In the first place you can find many descriptions in literature of how mystics and religious people came to the same things. The similarity of descriptions of these experiences is the best proof. All sorts of people in different countries, thousands of years apart, living in different conditions, have come to the same kind of experience by certain ways. Then you can find many people who have personal experience of this kind which proves that quite different states of perception and reaction exist. So it is not a hypothesis.</p>

<p> Q. I have recently had a very strange experience. I was talking to someone and trying to be aware of myself. Suddenly I saw my friend very clearly and realized that before this I had not really seen her at all.</p>
<p> A. This is a very good observation; it actually happens that way. When you tried to be aware of yourself, for a moment you became conscious and saw things you had not seen before. If you could keep this consciousness for, say, ten minutes, you would see many things which would astonish you. We look with our eyes and do not see; but if we become conscious, we begin to see things about which we have no idea. This is quite normal, if only you do not let imagination enter into it.</p>

<p> Q. Working to attain consciousness on the lines of the system, does there come a sudden change or illumination?</p>
<p> A. Sudden? No. What does sudden mean? You see, in the process of growth of unity, when this process has gone on for a long time, at some difficult moment you may feel different. It may look sudden, but it is not really so. It is the result of previous efforts.</p>

<p> Q. If potentiality for objective consciousness is the normal condition of man, how is it that only a few can develop?</p>
<p> A. When you try to make the first step towards objective consciousness, which is gaining self-consciousness, and you see how difficult it is and how many forces work in you against it, how many obstacles there are, you will have no doubt that only a few can attain it, that it is a possibility, but a very remote possibility. There are too many obstacles laziness, lying, inertia. We like to sleep.</p>

<p> Q. How and why did man come to be this being of false values?</p>
<p> A. What do you mean by false values? It is a relative concept: from one point of view they may be false, from another true. You can only find out for yourself whether man's development is an abstract idea or the truth. You must yourself come to one or another point of view. If you realize that change is only possible through awakening, then it becomes a fact, because you can see small degrees of awakening in yourself.</p>

<p> Q. If man does not remember himself, does it mean he has no consciousness?</p>
<p> A.You do not remember yourself; not man but you. If you try and fail, it does not mean you have no consciousness, but that you have not enough. Your own experience, however limited, can alone show the degree. When we use the word 'self-consciousness' we mean a certain degree, beyond our ordinary amount of consciousness. We have a certain amount of consciousness, but it is not sufficient for getting out of our state. If we had not a drop of consciousness, we
 would remain as we are.</p>

<p> Q. How is it possible to recognize self-remembering if we ever do?</p>
<p> A. First it must be understood by mind what it means and what it would mean to have it; and then it must be understood that one can be at different distances from it. Suppose one is not sure, but the distance between the state of self-remembering and your present state changes, and after a time you realize that one day it is five thousand miles and another day only three thousand miles. There is a difference. We cannot speak about several degrees at the same time; we can only speak about the next degree we can produce.</p>

<p> Q. I want to find out about the next degree.</p>
<p> A. This is all material for observation. You want to put labels on them, but you cannot; they change all the time. One moment it is almost self-consciousness, the next moment you are asleep. You must observe and see results. In one state you can understand certain things, in the next you cannot. In one state you identify, in another you have control; the more control there is, the nearer you are to self-consciousness. Talk will not help much, it will remain formatory. It is necessary to touch the emotional centre, and you can do that only by trying different things. Work is not simple: from the very beginning you must try to do impossible things impossible in the sense that they do not happen by themselves. There cannot be a text-book telling you to do first one thing, then another thing, and so on. At the same time questions about self-remembering must always be asked, because, for a long time, many mistakes are possible about it. So these questions must never be suppressed, for they are most important.</p>

<p> Q. Is there a connection between self-remembering and awakening?</p>
<p> A. Self-remembering is a method of awakening. What you are doing now is only preparation, only the study of the method. You must do as much as you can in your present state; then, when your inner situation changes, you will be able to use all the experience which you now acquire. But to reach the real meaning of self-remembering is possible only in very emotional states. Since you cannot create these emotional states, you cannot know what self-remembering is, but you can prepare for this experience; then when it comes you will know how to deal with it. Very high emotional energy is necessary for self-remembering. Now you are only practising, but without this practice you will never get the real state.</p>

<p> Q. When you say 'asleep' and 'awake', is there a definite line between the two?</p>
<p> A. No, they are transitory states. At the same time there is a line beyond which we neverpass.</p>

<p> Q. Is it a question of training?</p>
<p> A. It is more training of mind. We must learn to think in a different way, and above all to think more practically. We do not think practically as a rule we think mostly about things that do not concern us.</p>
  
<p> Q. Is then self-remembering a function of the intellectual centre? It appears to be an intellectual effort.</p>
<p> A. Self-remembering is the beginning and the centre of the system and the most important thing to understand. You cannot describe it as an intellectual action or intellectual idea. You have to begin studying what self-remembering means intellectually, but in actual fact it is not intellectual because it is a moment of will. It is necessary to remember yourself not at a quiet moment when nothing happens but when you know that you are doing something wrong and not do it. For instance, when you are identified, you must be able to feel it and then stop it and at the same time remember yourself, be aware that you are doing it, that mechanicalness causes you to be identified and that you are stopping it. That will be self-remembering.</p>

<p> Q. How can one start practising self-remembering?</p>
<p> A. You remember I gave the example of varying degrees of light in a room and a type writer. The type writer can be taken as the intellectual centre, and light as consciousness. Only, in the case of consciousness there is a certain connection between all centres, for in full light not only one but all centres work differently. Real self-remembering requires emotion, but we have no control over the emotional centre. So by a certain understanding we can make the intellectual centre, over which we have a certain control, work in the dark as though it were light, and this will produce self-remembering. Self-remembering means a form of thinking or intellectual work which corresponds to awakening, and in this way it induces a moment of awakening. Then, when one awakes for a moment, one realizes that generally one is asleep, that one is not conscious, and how dangerous it is. The more you put into it, the more you understand it, the better the result will be. If you realize what you lose by not remembering yourself and what you gain by remembering yourself, you will have a greater incentive for making efforts to self-remember. You will see that not
 remembering yourself is like finding yourself in an aeroplane, high above the earth, and fast asleep. This is in fact our situation, but we do not wish to realize it. If a man does realize it, then naturally he will make efforts to awake. But if he thinks he is just sitting in an easy chair and nothing particular is happening, he will think that there is no harm in sleeping.</p>

<p> Q. What is meant by putting one's thoughts in a form in which they would correspond to awakening?</p>
 A. As I said, thoughts are the only thing we can control. To a certain extent we can control movements, but in ordinary conditions, without special instruction, we can do nothing with movements. As regards thoughts, first of all we must throw out all thoughts connected with identification and think about the ideas of the system. This is preparation for self-remembering, because at every point we come to the necessity to remember ourselves. If you cannot remember yourself, try to revive the ideas of the system in your mind. The whole system, the study of man and the universe, is all help to self-remembering. This thinking will by itself remind you and create an inner atmosphere for it. But first you must eliminate all thoughts that stand in the way. If at this stage you cannot control thoughts, you can do nothing further. You may not control your temper, or your imagination, or your lying, but you must control your
 thoughts. At quiet moments you must be able to see when you are wrong. If you cannot, it means that you have not begun yet; but sooner or later one must begin.</p>

<p> Q. Should we, each of us, know what stands in our way?</p>
<p> A. Yes, certainly everyone must know. It is generally connected with some form of negativeness, or laziness, or fear.</p>

<p> Q. I still do not see what it means to try and think as we would think if we were more conscious.</p>
<p> A. Try to imagine yourself conscious that would be the right use of imagination. We develop this power of imagination in an absolutely wrong and useless way which is always making trouble for us. But now, for once, try to use it and imagine yourself conscious. Try to think how you would act, think, speak and so on. At first self-remembering is an effort on functions. You begin to remember yourself simply by forming your mental processes in a certain way, and this brings moments of consciousness. You cannot work on consciousness itself: you can make one or two spasmodic efforts, but no permanent efforts. But you can make efforts on thoughts, and in this way you can work on consciousness in a roundabout way. This is the most important part of the method. Try to understand the difference between remembering yourself in this way and being conscious. It is the same mental process that you use in everything, in reading, writing and all that you do, so you have a certain control over it. Even if we put the same amount of energy into self-remembering that we put into the study of a foreign language we would acquire a certain amount of consciousness. Unfortunately we do not want to put even that amount of energy into it; we think that these things must come by themselves, or that it is enough to try once and it must come. Self-remembering needs effort, so, if you continue to make these efforts, moments of consciousness will come more often and will stay longer. Then, gradually, self-remembering will cease to be purely intellectual it will have an awakening power.</p>

<p> Q. What will self-remembering be then emotion and sensation?</p>
<p> A. Emotion is a function and sensation is a function, but self-remembering is not. It is an attempt to create in oneself a state of consciousness without any relation to functions. From the very beginning we must understand that functions are one thing and states of consciousness another. You are now in a certain state of consciousness, and by trying to remember yourself you try to create an approach to the third state of consciousness. You do this by a certain <em>reconstruction</em>. You reconstruct a certain form of thinking which you have in higher states of consciousness. You cannot keep a flash of consciousness unless your thoughts are in a certain form. It is quite simple: you remember the example of the line of attention with two arrows? Attention is directed both on myself and on the thing I see. This double attention is the form of thinking corresponding to another state of consciousness.</p>

<p> Q. Is not self-remembering itself a state of consciousness?</p>
<p> A. It can be taken like that. At the same time it can be taken as a method for inducing self-consciousness.</p>

<p> Q. What is the relation of thought to consciousness?</p>
<p> A. It is very difficult to answer briefly. Thought is a mechanical process, it can work without, or with very little consciousness. And consciousness can exist without perceptible thought.</p>

<p> Q. If self-remembering can be taken either as a state of consciousness or as a method for inducing it, are there different kinds of self-remembering? Is it brought about by different qualities of thought?</p>
<p> A. One has to do many things besides thinking one has to make efforts. It is not only thinking. The difference is only that at first we can do very little. We have to begin from where we are. Then, if we continue, self-remembering will gradually become more emotional. It is not different qualities of thought that make the difference; it is different qualities of effort and underlying realization. Self-remembering is effective only if one realizes that one does not remember oneself but that one can remember oneself.</p>

<p> Q. Is not the act of giving attention a method of changing the state of consciousness?</p>
<p> A. A certain control of attention is necessary even in ordinary life. But attention can be drawn, or it can be controlled, and that is of quite a different value.</p>

<p> Q. I understood that we have a certain control of our thoughts in the sense of stopping certain kinds of thinking. But I have never heard before about constructing our thoughts.</p>
<p> A. We have the power not only not to think but also to think about this and that. So we can do both: we can eliminate useless thoughts and we can also put in the centre of our thinking the realization of 'I' 'I am here', 'I am thinking'.</p>

<p> Q. Why is it that an accident or a violent crisis brings self-remembering?</p>
<p> A. Every kind of emotional moment, emotional shock, makes you realize 'I am'. You realize it without any theory behind it: if you find yourself in a very unexpected place, you have a feeling of 'I' and 'here'; when you are in unusual circumstances it always reminds you of your existence. But in customary conditions we always forget.</p>

<p> Q. Is self-remembering the only strength the system hands out to us?</p>
<p><em> A. It is the only way to reach all the rest, because it is the first thing that is lacking in us. We are always forgetting ourselves from one moment to another, and this state must be changed. One must remember oneself this is the beginning and the end of the whole thing, because when one has that one has everything.</em></p>

<p> Q. What is the distinction in the meaning of attention and consciousness?</p>
<p> A. Attention can be regarded as the elementary beginning of consciousness the first degree. It is not full awareness for it is only directed one way. As I said, consciousness needs double attention.</p>

<p> Q. What is the object of attaining this higher consciousness to live more fully?</p>
<p> A. One thing depends on another. If we want to have will, if we want to be free instead of being marionettes, if we want to awake, we must develop consciousness. If we realize that we are asleep and that all people are asleep, and what it means, then all the absurdities of life are explained. It is quite clear that people cannot do anything differently from what they do now if they are asleep.</p>

<p> Q. As we are, would we ever be able to be conscious when we want to be, or does it always come accidentally?</p>
<p> A. Nothing comes in its full state at once. The first step is to be more conscious, the second step is to be still more conscious. If, with effort, you can now make yourself be conscious for a minute, then, if you work on it and do all that is possible to help, after some time you will be able to be conscious for five minutes.</p>

<p> Q. Is it wrong when it is accidental?</p>
<p> A. You cannot rely on it. As we are, higher states cannot last; they are just flashes, and if they last, then it is imagination. This is a definite fact because we have no energy for lasting higher states. Flashes are possible, only again you must judge and classify them by what material they bring.</p>

<p> Q. Cannot they last in memory even?</p>
<p> A. The memory that we can command, control and use is only intellectual, and intellectual memory cannot keep them.</p>

<p> Q. It seems to me quite impossible to self-remember at will, although it seems not quite so difficult to observe myself.</p>
<p> A. You must try methods that will produce it. Try this method of stopping your thoughts, to see for how long you can keep your thoughts down, to think about nothing if you know about self-remembering. But suppose a man who does not
 know about self-remembering tries this he will not come to the idea of self-remembering in this way. If you already know, that will create a moment of self-remembering; for how long will depend on your efforts. It is a very good way. This method is described, for instance, in some books on Yoga, but people who try it do not know why they are doing it, so it cannot produce good results. Quite the opposite, it may produce a kind of trance state.</p>

<p> Q. When you said 'knowing about self-remembering', did you mean if you have it in your head as an aim, or if you had a taste of it?</p>
<p> A. There are different degrees. You see, we speak about self-remembering all the time; we always come back to it; so you cannot say you do not know about self-remembering. But if you take a man who has studied ordinary psychology or
 philosophy, he does not know about it.</p>

<p> Q. Is it possible to have done self-remembering before one met this system? I ask because I have tried to self-remember and the results seem to correspond to what I used to do before, without knowing what I was doing.</p>
<p> A. That's the thing. You can study it to understand the principle that if you do a certain thing knowing what it is, it gives one result, and if you do almost the same thing without knowing what it is, it gives a different result. Many people came very near to self-remembering in practice, others came very near to it in theory but without practice either theory without practice, or practice without theory and neither from the one nor from the other did they cometo the real truth. For instance, in the so-called Yoga literature there are many near approaches to self-remembering. For example, they speak about 'I am' consciousness, but they are so theoretical that you cannot get anything out of it. Self-remembering was never mentioned in any literature in an exact, concrete form, although in a disguised form it is spoken about in the New Testament and in Buddhist writings. For instance, when it is said, 'Watch, do not sleep', this is self-remembering. But people interpret it differently.</p>

<p> Q. Is emotional centre the chief centre that works in self-remembering?</p>
<p> A. You cannot control emotions. You simply decide to remember yourself. I have given you a very simple, practical method. Try to stop your thoughts but, at the same time, do not forget your aim that you do it in order to remember yourself. That may help. What prevents self-remembering? This constant turning of thoughts. Stop this turning, and perhaps you will have a taste of it.</p>

<p> Q. What centres work in self-remembering?</p>
<p> A. Self-remembering needs the best work you can produce, so the more centres that take part in it the better the result. Self-remembering cannot be produced by slow, weak work - the work of one or two centres. You may begin with two centres, but it is not sufficient, because other centres can interrupt your self-remembering and stop it. But if you put all centres to the work there is nothing that can stop it. You must always remember that self-remembering needs the best work you are capable of.</p>

<p> Q. You said real self-remembering needs emotion, but when I think of it I do not experience any emotion. Can one remember oneself without emotional experience?</p>
<p> A. The idea is to remember oneself, to be aware of oneself. And what comes with it you just notice, you must not put any definite demands upon it. If you make it a regular practice to try and remember yourself three or four times a day, self-remembering will come by itself in the intervals, when you need it. But that you will notice later. You must make it a regular practice to try and remember yourself, if possible at the sametimes of the day. And, as I said, the practice of stopping thoughts will produce the same effect. So, if you cannot remember yourself, try stopping thoughts. You can stop thoughts, but you must not be disappointed if at first you cannot. Stopping thoughts is a very difficult thing. You cannot say to yourself I will stop thoughts', and they stop. You have to use effort all the time. So you must not do it for long. If you do it for a few minutes it is quite sufficient, otherwise you will persuade yourself that you are doing it when instead you will just sit quietly and think and be very happy about it. As much as you can you must keep only one thought, 'I do not want to think about anything', and throw all other thoughts out. It is avery good exercise, but only an exercise.</p>

<p> Q. Is it bad to stop breathing when one tries to stop thoughts?</p>
<p> A. This question was asked once in our old groups and Mr. Gurdjieff asked: 'For how long?' Theman said for ten minutes. Mr. Gurdjieff answered: 'If you can stop breathing for ten minutes it is very good, because after four minutes you die!'</p>

<p> Q. Are self-remembering and stopping thoughts the same thing?</p>
<p> A. Not exactly; they are two different methods. In the first you bring in a certain definite thought the realization that you do not remember yourself. You must always start with that. And stopping thought is simply creating a right atmosphere, right surroundings, for self-remembering. So they are not the same thing, but they bring the same results.</p>

<p> Q. Is one's work more accurate if one is remembering oneself and the work one is doing?</p>
<p> A. Yes, when you are awake you can do everything better, but a long time is necessary for that. When you get accustomed to self-remembering you will not be able to understand how you ever worked without it. But in the beginning it is difficult to work and to remember oneself at the same time. Still, efforts in this direction give very interesting results; of that there can be no doubt. All experience of all times shows that these efforts are always rewarded. Besides, if you make these efforts you will understand that certain things one can only do in sleep and cannot do when one is awake, because some things can only be mechanical. For instance, suppose you forget or lose things: you cannot lose things on purpose, you can lose them only mechanically.</p>

<p> Q. While performing on the piano, when I thought 'I am here' I did not know what I was doing.</p>
<p> A. Because this is not being conscious, it is thinking about self-remembering. Then it interferes with what you are doing; just as when you are writing and suddenly think 'How is this word spelt?' you cannot remember. This is one function interfering with another. But real self- remembering is not in centres, it is above centres. It cannot interfere with the work of centres, only one will see more, one will see one's mistakes. We must realize that the capacity for remembering oneself is our right. We do not have it, but we can have it; we have all the necessary organs for it, so to speak, but we are not trained, not accustomed to using them. It is necessary to createa certain particular energy or point, using this word in an ordinary sense, and this can be created only at a moment of a serious emotional stress. Everything before that is only preparation of the method. But if you find yourself in a moment of very strong
 emotional stress and try to remember yourself then, it will remain after the stress is over, and then you will be able to remember yourself. So only with very intense emotion is it possible to create this foundation for self-remembering. But it cannot be done if you do not prepare yourself before hand. Moments may come, but you will get nothing from them. These emotional moments come from time to time, but we do not use them, because we do not know how to use them. If you try sufficiently hard to remember yourself during a moment of intense emotion, and if the emotional stress is strong enough, it will leave a certain trace, and this will help you to remember yourself in the future.</p>

<p> Q. So what we are doing now is a sort of practising?</p>
<p> A. Now you are only studying yourselves, you can do nothing else.</p>

<p> Q. What is this preparation you are speaking about?</p>
<p> A. Self-study, self-observation, self-understanding. We can change nothing yet, nor make a single thing different. It all happens in the same way as before. But there is a difference already, for you see many things you could not have seen before, and many things 'happen' differently. It does not mean you have changed anything: they happen differently.</p>

<p> Q. Is our life long enough to attain results?</p>
<p> A. You come to the understanding of this point through self-remembering. When you reach certain results in it, if it comes often like seeing oneself in a mirror then there comes another form of self-remembering, remembering one's life, the time-body. This increases possibilities. There are also other steps, but we can only speak of one step ahead, otherwise it would be imagination. We must understand that we must not touch certain questions without self-remembering. It is a question of perfecting our instrument of cognition. Our mind is very limited by our state of consciousness. We can hope that certain things will become comprehensible if our state of consciousness changes.</p>

<p> Q. Can self-consciousness give knowledge?</p>
</p> A. No, consciousness does not, by itself, give knowledge. Knowledge must be acquired. No amount of consciousness can give knowledge and no amount of knowledge can give consciousness. They are not parallel and cannot replace one
 another. But when you become conscious you see things you have not seen before. If you keep it long enough it produces an enormous effect. The whole world would be different if you could keep it up for, say, fifteen minutes. But one cannot be aware of oneself for fifteen minutes without a very strong emotional element. You must produce something that makes you emotional; you cannot do it without the help of the emotional centre.</p>

<p> Q. It does not come by itself?</p>
<p> A. It is a question of destroying obstacles. We are not sufficiently emotional, because we spend our energy on identification, negative emotions, critical attitude, suspicion, lying and things like that. If we manage to stop this waste, we will be more emotional.</p>

<p> Q. In endeavouring to remember myself I find that I should avoid too much effort. I feel that one can swamp the effect by excessive effort.</p>
<p> A. What you mean is not too much effort, but a wrong kind of effort. Muscular effort will not help you to remember yourself. It is necessary for each person to find for himself the moment to make this particular big effort,especially at moments when all instinctive and emotional tendencies go against it. This is the moment to make effort. If you manage to remember yourself then, you will know how to do it.</p>

<p> Q. How can one prevent regular efforts becoming just formal; how can one stop the meaning slipping out of them?</p>
<p> A. Self-remembering cannot become formal; if it does it means deep sleep. Then it is necessary to do something to wake oneself up. But you must always start with the idea of mechanicalness and the results of mechanicalness. You are quite right. Everything slips away and disappears, and you find yourself again with nothing. Again you start with some conscious effort, again it slips away. The question is how to prevent it disappearing. In our ordinary ways of thinking and feeling there are many mechanical tendencies which always turn us in the usual way. We want to think in another way, we want to be different, to work in another way, to feel in a new way, but nothing happens, because there are so many old tendencies which turn us back. We must study these tendencies and try to throw light on them. Above all, we must overcome the inertia of mind; then, if we do, twenty-four hours will not be sufficient and life will become very full. It is difficult to begin and yet it is not so difficult.</p>

<p> Q. How can one conquer this inertia?</p>
<p> A. By effort: effort to self-remember, to observe, not to identify. Consciousness is a force, and force can only be developed by overcoming obstacles. Two things can be developed in man consciousness and will. Both are forces. If man overcomes unconsciousness, he will possess consciousness; if he overcomes mechanicalness he will possess will. If he understands the nature of the powers he can attain, it will be clear to him that they cannot be given; these powers must be developed by effort. If we were made more conscious, we would remain conscious machines. Mr. Gurdjieff told me that in some schools they could, by some special methods, make a sheep conscious. But it just remained a conscious sheep. I asked him what they did with it, and he said they ate it. The idea of the conscious sheep is this: suppose a man is made conscious by someone else; he will become an instrument in the hands of others. One's own efforts are necessary, because otherwise, even if a man is made conscious, he will not be able to use it. It is in the very nature of things that consciousness and will cannot be given. If someone could give them to you, it would not be an advantage. This is the reason why one must buy everything, nothing is given free. The most difficult thing is to learn how to pay. But if it could be explained in a few words, there would be no need to go to school. One has to pay not only for consciousness but for everything. Not the smallest idea can become one's own until one has paid for it.</p>

<p> Q. Self-remembering seems to be a very sad and cheerless experience. Is it a sad system?</p>
<p> A. There are no sad systems as far as I know; only sad people and sad attitudes, sad understanding. And I do not understand why self-remembering should be cheerless and sad. It is the realization of the fact that one is asleep. If one realized that one was asleep and there was no chance of awakening, then indeed it would be a cheerless realization, I quite agree. But the system does not say you should stop at that; it says that you should try to awake. And this is quite another thing. I remember, when I first heard this idea, I saw many quite new things, because it was an answer to all the questions I had when I studied psychology. So I realized at once that psychology begins at this point. I understood that man does not remember himself but could remember himself if he made sufficient efforts. Without self-remembering there can be no study, no psychology. But if a man realizes and bears in mind that he does not remember himself, and that nobody remembers, and yet there is a possibility of self-remembering, then study begins. This is how it must be understood. Certainly there can be no joy in realizing that one is a machine and asleep. But we
 do not speak about joy or suffering, we speak about control. We realize that we are machines, and we do not want to be machines. We realize that we are asleep, and we want to awake. Real joy can only be connected with awakening or with something that helps awakening.</p>

<p> Q. But so many people are self-conscious in a bad sense of the word. Isn't that a form of self-remembering too?</p>
<p> A. Not at all. What is called being self-conscious in English is a form of embarrassment or shyness; it has nothing to do with self-remembering. As I have explained, if you are not awake you cannot make yourself awake; but you have some control over thoughts and you must construct them in such a way as to bring you to awakening.</p>

<p> Q. Is a child nearer to self-remembering than a grown-up person? One has such vivid memories of childhood.</p>
<p> A. No, not quite; it is not self-remembering. Self-remembering means conscious work, I mean intentional work. Vivid memories of childhood are due to the activity of the emotional centre. In a child it is more active, and moments of consciousness come by themselves. But self-remembering is a moment of consciousness that comes by your own effort. Suppose a child has flashes of consciousness without the possibility of using these moments? It does not help at all.</p>

<p> Q. Would it not help us to try to get back to those states we had in childhood?</p>
<p> A. How? That is the question. If we could stop identification, we would have many moments like that, but we do not know how to begin to stop identification. If we could destroy negative emotions, if we could remember ourselves, then those things would be in our hands, under our control, not accidental.</p>

<p> Q. When well washed and carefully dressed I feel it is much easier to self-remember.</p>
<p> A. It is not at all prohibited. This is not a fakir way.</p>

<p> Q. What is the relationship between self-remembering and negative emotions?</p>
<p> A. When negative emotion appears, self-remembering becomes impossible. So to remember oneself one must have a certain control of negative emotions. As a matter of fact, people are not equal in this respect: some have more, some less control even of the expression. And not only of the expression, for some people have more control of their emotions, some can control only certain emotions. And certainly only those who have a certain control of negative emotions can work on self-remembering and get good results. At the same time this control can be attained; one can begin from different sides, and if certain self-remembering is created, this immediately helps one to struggle with negative emotions; and struggle with negative emotions helps self-remembering.</p>
  
<p> Q. Does it always take a long time to awake?</p>
<p> A. I can only say how much time it takes to know this system, but I cannot say how much time it takes to awake. Awakening is the result of personal work, so it is difficult to foretell. It goes by degrees. Complete awakening means a very big change, and that needs time, because it means acquiring new psychic functions. So we can only study degrees or steps which a man must pass through. One can be shown the way, but one must work for oneself. By itself learning is a small thing, for man can change himself only through the application of the knowledge he gets. Man can become conscious of himself at a given moment. This consciousness of himself is awakening one of the attributes of another state of consciousness.</p>

<p> Q. Could a person wish to wake up and fail to do so?</p>
<p> A. Maybe for a long time he will fail, but if he is capable of awakening he can awake; it is a long process. But certainly he may fail. We have only one good feature in our situation we have nothing to lose. So if we fail we will be in the same position as before, but if we succeed we gain something new.</p>

<p> Q. Does any great effort tend to make one more conscious at the time?</p>
<p> A. That depends on the effort, because if one just makes a great effort to do something in a state of identification, one will not be more conscious.</p>

<p> Q. Does self-remembering automatically stop identification?</p>
<p> A. There is nothing automatic in self-remembering every moment is effort. If it is sufficiently deep and sufficiently long it is one thing, but if it is just a flash it is not sufficient. Also, if you remember yourself to exclusion of everything else, it is one thing, and if you remember yourself and at the same time remember your aim and what you are doing, it is another thing. It depends on how much enters into self-remembering.</p>

<p> Q. Would you call it self-consciousness?</p>
<p> A. Self-consciousness is a permanent state. Self-remembering is an experiment; one day it may be successful and another day unsuccessful. It may be deeper or less deep.</p>

<p> Q. Can we be told about the things that may be keeping us back?</p>
<p> A. We are talking about just those things. There are two things that are keeping us back ignorance and weakness: we do not know enough and we are not strong enough. The question is how to know more. By self-study that is the only method. Then comes the struggle with identification and imagination, the chief causes of weakness. Only, in individual cases these things take on a different colour. What looks one colour for one person looks a different colour for another person. But the things that keep us back are more or less the same.</p>

<p> Q. Is there nothing between self-awareness and identifying?</p>
<p> A. They are on different levels, you cannot compare them. You cannot identify and be aware of yourself; the presence of one means the absence of the other. All things are connected, not a single manifestation is separate; they are all connected with a certain order of things.</p>

<p> Q. I think I have not got the right idea about identification. Does it mean that things control us and not that we control things?</p>
<p> A. Identification is a very difficult thing to describe, because no definitions are possible. Such as we are we are never free from identifying. If we believe that we do not identify with something, we are identified with the idea that we are not identified. You cannot describe identification in logical terms. You have to find a moment of identification, catch it, and then compare things with that moment. Identification is every where, at every moment of ordinary life. When you begin self-observation, some forms of identification already become impossible. But in ordinary life almost everything is identification. It is a very important psychological feature that permeates the whole of ourlife, and we do not notice it because we are in it. The best way to understand it is to find some examples. For instance, if you see a cat with a rabbit ora mouse this is identification. Then find analogies to this picture in yourself. Only, you must understand that it is there every moment, not only at exceptional moments. Identification is an almost permanent state in us. You must be able to see this state apart from yourself, separate it from yourself, and that can only be done by trying to become more conscious, trying to remember yourself, to be aware of yourself. Only when you become more aware of yourself are you able to struggle with manifestations like identification.</p>

<p> Q. I find when I am identified it is nearly always with things inside me.</p>
<p> A. Perhaps you are right; perhaps you are not right. You may think you are identified with one thing when in reality you are identified with quite a different thing. This does not matter at all; what matters is the state of identification. In the state of identification you cannot feel right, see right, judge right. But the subject of identification is not important: the result is the same.</p>

<p> Q. So what is the way to overcome identification?</p>
<p> A. That is another thing. It is different in different cases. First it is necessary to see; then it is necessary to put something against it.</p>

<p> Q. What do you mean by 'put something against it'?</p>
<p> A. Just turn your attention to something more important. You must learn to distinguish the important from the less important, and if you turn your attention to more important things you become less identified with unimportant things. You must realize that identification can never help you; it only makes things more confused and more difficult. If you realize even that that alone may help in somecases. People think that to be identified helps them, they do not see that it only makes things more difficult. It has no useful energy at all, only destructive energy.</p>

<p> Q. Is identification mainly emotion?</p>
<p> A. It always has an emotional element a kind of emotional disturbance, but sometimes it becomes a habit, so that one does not even notice the emotion.</p>

<p> Q. I realize that it is important to be emotional in the right way, but when I feel something emotionally in the work, I soon destroy the whole thing.</p>
<p> A. Only identification is destructive. Emotion can only give new energy, new understanding. You take identification for emotion. You do not know emotion without identification, so, in the beginning, you cannot visualize an emotion free from it. People often think they speak about an emotional function when in reality they speak about identification.</p>

<p> Q. Is it possible for us, as we are now, to have any feeling at all without identifying?</p>
<p> A. Very difficult, unless we begin to watch ourselves. Then easy kinds of identification I mean easy individually will respond to treatment. But everyone has his own specialities in identification. For instance, it is easy for me not to identify with music, for another it may be very difficult.</p>

<p> Q. Is love without identification possible?</p>
<p> A. I would say love is impossible with identification. Identification kills all emotions, except negative emotions. With identification only the unpleasant side remains.</p>

<p> Q. Non-identifying does not mean aloofness?</p>
<p> A. On the contrary, aloofness needs identification. Non-identifying is quite a different thing.</p>

<p> Q. If you are identified with an idea, how can you stop it?</p>
<p> A. First by understanding what identification means and then by trying to remember yourself. Begin with simple cases, then later you can deal with the more difficult.</p>

<p> Q. As you develop self-remembering do you acquire a sort of detached attitude, more free from identification?</p>
<p> A. Detached attitude in the sense that you know your attitudes better; you know what is useful to you and what is not useful. If you do not remember yourself it is easy to make a mistake about it. For instance, one can undertake some kind of study that is really quite useless. Self-remembering helps understanding, and understanding always means bringing everything to a certain centre. You must have a central point in all your work, in all your attitudes, and self-remembering is a necessary condition for that. We must talk more about identifying if it is not clear. It will become more clear when you find two or three good examples. It is a certain state in which you are in the power of things.</p>

<p> Q. If I look closely and think deeply, does it mean I have become identified?</p>
<p> A. No, identifying is a special thing, it means losing oneself. As I said, it is not so much a question of what one is identified with. Identification is a state. You must understand that many things you ascribe to things outside you are really in you. Take for instance fear. Fear is independent of things. If you are in a state of fear, you can be afraid of an ash-tray. This often happens in pathological states, and a pathological state is only an intensified ordinary state. You are afraid, and then you choose what to be afraid of. This fact makes it possible to struggle with these things, because they are in you.</p>

<p> Q. Can we have any understanding with identification?</p>
<p> A. How much can you understand in deep sleep, which is what identification is? If you remember your aim, realize your position and see the danger of sleep, it will help you to sleep less.</p>

<p> Q. What is the difference between sympathy and identification?</p>
<p> A. It is quite another thing; it is a normal and legitimate emotion and can exist without identification. There may be sympathy without identification and sympathy with identification. When sympathy is mixed with identification, it often ends in anger or another negative emotion.</p>

<p> Q. You spoke of losing oneself in identification. Which self?</p>
<p> A. All, everything. Identifying is a very interesting idea. There are two stages in the process of identifying. The first stage denotes the process of becoming identified, the second a state when identification is complete.</p>

<p> Q. The first stage is quite harmless?</p>
<p> A. If it attracts too much attention and occupies too much time, it leads to the second.</p>

<p> Q. When you desire something, can you desire it without identification?</p>
<p> A. Identification is not obligatory. But if you desire to hit someone, you cannot do it without identification; if identification disappears, you do not want to any longer. It is possible not to lose oneself; losing oneself is not a necessary element at all.</p>

<p> Q. Is it possible to identify with two things at once?</p>
<p> A. With ten thousand! It is necessary to observe and observe. From one point of view struggling with identification is not so difficult, because, if we can see it, it becomes so ridiculous that we cannot remain identified. Other people's identification always seems ridiculous and ours may become so too. Laughter may be useful in this respect if we can turn it on ourselves.</p>

<p> Q. I cannot see why identification is a bad thing.</p>
<p> A. Identification is a bad thing if you want to awake, but if you want to sleep, then it is a good thing.</p>

 <p> Q. Would not everything we do suffer if we kept our minds on keeping awake instead of attending to what we are doing?</p>
<p> A. I have already explained that it is quite the opposite. We can do well whatever we are doing only as much as we are awake. The more we are asleep, the worse we do the thing we are doing there are no exceptions. You take it academically, simply as a word, but between deep sleep and complete awakening there are different degrees, and you pass from one degree to another.</p>

<p> Q. If we feel more awake, we should not overtax these moments, should we?</p>
<p> A. How can we overtax them? These moments are too short even if we have glimpses. We can only try not to forget them and act in accordance with these moments. This is all we can do.</p>

<p> Q. Can you say that identification is being in the grip of something, not being able to shake off some idea in mind?</p>
<p> A. Being in the grip of things is an extreme case. There are many small identifications which are very difficult to observe, and these are the most important because they keep us mechanical. We must realize that we always pass
 from one identification to another. If a man looks at a wall, he is identified with the wall.</p>

<p> Q. How does identification differ from associations?</p>
<p> A. Associations are quite another thing; they can be more controlled or less controlled, but they have nothing to do with identification. Different associations are a necessary part of thinking; we define things by associations and we do everything with the help of associations.</p>

<p> Q. I cannot see why an 'I' changes. Can the cause always be seen in some identification?</p>
<p> A. It is always by associations. A certain number of 'I's try to push their way to the front, so as soon as one loses oneself in one of them it is replaced by another. We think that 'I's are just passive, indifferent things, but emotions, associations, memories, always work. That is why it is useful to stop thinking, even occasionally, as an exercise. Then you will begin to see how difficult it is to do it. Your question simply shows that you have never tried,
 otherwise you would know.</p>

<p> Q. Is concentration identification?</p>
<p> A. Concentration is controlled action; identification controls you.</p>

<p> Q. Is concentration possible for us?</p>
<p> A. There are degrees. Intentional concentration for half an hour is impossible. If we could concentrate without external help, we would be conscious. But everything has degrees.</p>

<p> Q. Is the beginning of a new observation identification with the object you observe?</p>
<p> A. Identification happens when you are repelled or attracted by something. Study or observation does not necessarily produce identification, but attraction and repulsion always does. Also, we use too strong a language, and this automatically produces identification. We have many automatic appliances of this sort.</p>

<p> Q. What can I do about identification? I feel that I always lose myself in whatever I do. It does not seem possible to be different.</p>
<p> A. No, it is possible. If you have to do something, you have to do it, but you may identify more or identify less. There is nothing hopeless in it so long as you remember about it. Try to observe; you do not always identify to the same extent; sometimes you identify so that you can see nothing else, at other times you can see something. If things were always the same, there would be no chance for us, but they always vary in degree of intensity, and that gives a possibility of change. Everything we do, we have to learn in advance. If you want to drive a car, you have to learn before hand. If you work now, in time you will have more control.</p>

<p> Q. Why is it wrong to be completely absorbed in one's work?</p>
<p> A. It will be bad work. If you are identified, you can never get good results. It is one of our illusions to think that we must lose ourselves to get good results, for in this way we only get poor results. When one is identified, one
 does not exist; only the thing exists with which one is identified.</p>

<p> Q. Is the aim of non-identifying to free the mind from the object?</p>
<p> A. The aim is to awake. Identifying is a feature of sleep; identified mind is asleep. Freedom from identifying is one of the sides of awakening. A state where identifying does not exist is quite possible, but we do not observe it in
 life and we do not notice that we are constantly identified. Identifying cannot disappear by itself; struggle is necessary.</p>

<p> Q. How can any one awake if identification is universal?</p>
<p> A. One can only awake as a result of effort, of struggle against it. But first one must understand what to identify means. As in everything else, so in identification there are degrees. In observing oneself one finds when one is more identified, less identified or not identified at all. If one wants to awake, one must and can get free from identification. As we are, every moment of our life we are lost, we are never free, because we identify.</p>

<p> Q. Can you give an example of identification?</p>
<p> A. We identify all the time, that is why it is difficult to give an example. For instance, take likes and dislikes, they all mean identification, especially dislikes. They cannot exist without identification and generally they are nothing but identification. Usually people imagine that they have many more dislikes than they actually have. If they investigate and analyse them, they will probably find that they only dislike one or two things. When I studied it, there was only one real dislike that I could find in myself. But you must find your own examples; it must be verified by personal experience. If at a moment of a strong identification you try to stop it, you will see the idea.</p>

<p> Q. But I still do not understand what it is!</p>
<p> A. Let us try from the intellectual side. You realize that you do not remember yourself? Try to see why you cannot and you will find that identification prevents you. Then you will see what it is. All these things are connected.</p>

<p> Q. Is non-identifying the only way to know what identifying is?</p>
<p> A. No, as I explained, by observing it, because it is not always the same. We do not notice the temperature of our body except when it becomes a little higher or lower than normal. In the same way we can notice identification when it is stronger or weaker than usual. By comparing these degrees we can see what it is.</p>

<p> Q. In struggling with identification is it necessary to know why one is identified?</p>
<p> A. One is identified not for any particular reason or purpose, but in all cases because one cannot help it. How can you know why you identify? But you must know why you struggle. This is the thing. If you do not forget the reason why, you will be ten times more successful. Very often we begin struggling and then forget why. There are many forms of identification, but the first step is to see it; the second step is to struggle with it in order to become free from it. As I said, it is a process, not a moment; we are in it all the time. We spend our energy in the wrong way on identification and negative emotions; they are open taps from which our energy flows out.</p>

<p> Q. Can one suddenly change the energy of anger into something else? One has tremendous energy at these moments.</p>
<p> A. One has tremendous energy, and it works by itself, without control, and makes one act in a certain way. Why? What is the connecting link? Identification is the link. Stop identification and you will have this energy at your disposal. How can you do this? Not at once; it needs practice at easier moments. When emotion is very strong you cannot do it. It is necessary to know more, to be prepared. If you know how not to identify at the right moment, you will have great energy at your disposal. What you do with it is another thing; you may lose it again on something quite useless. But it needs practice. You cannot learn to swim when you fall into the sea during a storm you must learn in calm water. Then, if you fall in, you may perhaps be able to swim. I repeat again:<em> it is impossible to be conscious if you are identified.</em> This is one of the difficulties that comes later, because people have some favourite identifications which they do not want to give up, and at the same time they say they want to be conscious. The two things cannot go together. There are many incompatible things in life, and identification and consciousness are two of the most incompatible.</p>

<p> Q. How can one avoid the reaction which comes after feeling very enthusiastic? Is it due to identification?</p>
<p> A. Yes, this reaction comes as a result of identification. Struggle with identification will prevent it from happening. It is not what you call enthusiasm that produces the reaction, but the identification. Identification is always followed by this reaction.</p>

<p> Q. Is a bored man identified with nothing?</p>
<p> A. Boredom is also identification one of the biggest. It is identification with oneself, with something in oneself.</p>

<p> Q. Is it not possible that, by acquiring certain knowledge and power through self-remembering and other practices, man can use this power for evil purposes?</p>
<p> A. You see, an inevitable part of the process of self-development is the awakening of conscience, and the awakening of conscience will prevent any possibility of using new powers for any wrong aim or purpose. This must be definitely understood from the very beginning, because conscience, when it awakes, will not allow one to do anything selfish or contrary to other people's interests, or harmful to anybody - nothing, in fact, that we may consider wrong or evil. And conscience has to be awakened, because with unawakened conscience one will always make mistakes and will not see contradictions in oneself.</p>

<p> Q. I have never been able to get any evidence that anybody has achieved self-remembering.</p>
<p> A. You will not see the evidence. If all other people were able to remember themselves and you were not, it would not help you.</p>

<p> Q. Yes it would, because they would have more information.</p>
<p> A. For themselves, not for you. You must prove it to yourself. No one can prove it for you.</p>

<p> Q. Because we work on ourselves, it does not mean that we shall gain higher consciousness, does it?</p>
<p> A. No, it may take a very long time. We want to acquire control of higher states of consciousness, but before that the system speaks of acquiring control over ordinary faculties, over thoughts, over emotions, and in acquiring this control we must eliminate certain things and create the possibility of self-remembering. So first we must acquire control over simple, ordinary things. Only then can we expect more. In this system there are gradual steps, one cannot jump.</p>

<p> Q. Can you give an example of different human activities?</p>
<p> A. Take two simple examples in order to understand the idea. To build a house, effort is needed at every moment, every single brick must be put into place with a certain effort; no triad passes into another triad without effort. At last the house is built and furnished. Then, if you want to burn it, you just strike a match and put it to something inflammable, and the house is burnt. If you go deeper into it you will see that these are two different activities. You cannot build a house by the same activity as you burn it. In the second case one triad passes into another without any effort, automatically, after the first initial effort of striking a match.

 Examples of the third kind of triad, in our experience, can be found only in conscious work, not identified work, or in some activity that has a peculiar quality of its own that cannot be imitated by others, such as artistic creation. Efforts at self-remembering and not identifying belong to this category. If you think about it you will understand that in order to paint a good picture, for instance, one must use a different triad from the one used in building a house or the one used for burning a house; something else is needed.

 Another triad may be called invention, discovery, craft. If you think about these four different activities, they will give you material for observing and comparing. Try to see why and in what they are different.</p>

<p> Q. I find it possible to struggle with smaller negative emotions, but sometimes they are too strong and there is an explosion.</p>
<p> A. I tried to explain that negative emotions are different, and you cannot use the same methods against all of them. In all cases you must be prepared. It is too late to think when you are already in the negative emotion. You must study identification and be able not to identify; you must be able to think in the right way not at that moment but before and after. And you must be able to use negative emotions for self-remembering. But before all that you must be able to control the manifestation of negative emotions. If you cannot control the manifestation, you cannot start struggling with negative emotions themselves. But you must understand that you can do nothing when you are in the negative emotion; you can do it before and after. Sometimes, when you are better prepared, you can use them for self-remembering, but that is quite a special thing. In the work everything can be used, all wrong functions can be used, so negative emotions of all kinds can be useful as a help for self-remembering. By that I mean that you can train yourself in such a way that negative emotions will remind you of the necessity of remembering yourself.</p>

<p> Q. Did you say that negative emotions would be useful if we could be not identified with them?</p>
<p> A. If we could be not identified, we would have different results. That would help very definitely, since it would give orientation to life and many other things we do not know yet.

 Yes, I said if we could not identify they would be very useful functions. As they are, they are not useful. All negative emotions that we cannot avoid become useful functions if we use them for self-remembering. Some people manage to do that and get two things at once elimination of the negative emotion and creation of self-remembering. If you have a persistent negative emotion and by right thinking connect it with self-remembering, then, after some time, it will help self-remembering, and after some more time, if you persist, the emotion will disappear. So they can serve a useful purpose if you can use them; but if you identify with them, they are no good at all.</p>

<p> Q. I could see myself losing my temper the other day when I was talking to somebody, but I could not stop it. How can I control temper?</p>
<p> A. This is an example of mechanicalness. You cannot control your temper when it has already begun to appear it is then too late. Struggle must begin in your mind, you must find your way to think rightly about a definite difficulty. Supposeyou have to meet a certain man who irritates you. Your temper shows itself, you do not like it. How can you stop it? You must begin with the study of your thinking. What do you think about this man not what you feel when you are irritated, but what do you think about him at quiet moments? You may find that in your mind you argue with him, you prove to him that he is wrong, you tell him all his mistakes, you find that, generally, he behaves wrongly towards you. This is where you are wrong. You must learn to think rightly. Then, if you do, it will happen like this although emotion is much quicker than thought, emotion is a temporary thing, but thought can be made continuous, so whenever the emotion jumps out, it hits against this continuous thought and cannot go on and manifest itself. So you can struggle with the expression of negative emotions, as in this example, only by creating continuous right thinking. To explain what right thinking is in a few words is impossible, it is necessary to study it. If you remember what I said about parts of centres you will come to that, because in most cases and most conditions in ordinary life people think only with the mechanical part of the intellectual centre, which is the formatory apparatus. This is not sufficient. It is necessary to use the intellectual part of the intellectual centre. Identifying is the chief reason why we do not use it. Trying to self-remember and trying not to identify is the best means of passing into higher parts of centres. But we always forget about identification and about self-remembering.</p>

<p> Q. Can conquering negative emotions, like fear, create energy?</p>
<p> A. Very much so. This is one of the best means of collecting energy. All possibilities of development are contained in conquering negative emotions and transforming them.</p>

<p> A man with negative emotions will never do anything.</p>

<p> Q. Into what kind of things can negative emotions be transformed?</p>
<p> A. It is better to say they must be conquered. But, if you like, we can say that they are transformed into some kind of emotion mixed with very much understanding an emotion of higher parts of centres. Almost any negative emotion we have now can be transformed into an emotion of higher parts of centres. But this needs understanding, conviction that it is necessary, and decision to do it.</p>

<p> Q. I find enjoyment a great difficulty. I enjoy almost everything, and this seems to send me to sleep.</p>
<p> A. Try to remember yourself, then enjoyment will be bigger, fuller and you will profit from it. But if it makes you fall asleep, you must try to avoid it, that is all. Every kind of emotional state can be used for self-remembering, but before you can do that it is necessary to create a capacity for it; and the capacity can be created only by constant, regular effort. If you just think about it once a week, nothing will come of it.</p>

<p> Prayer is also an inseparable part of any religion; but prayer can be very different. Prayer can be a petition for help in anything we may undertake, and also, through school-work, prayer can become help itself. It can become an instrument of work which can be used for reviving ideas of the system, it can be used for self-remembering and for reminding us about sleep and the necessity for awakening.</p>`,
